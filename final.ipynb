Highlights RESULTS FOR THE YEAR • Revenue increased 7% to £560.8m (2016: £525.7m), including £2.2m from share in a joint venture • Engineering Services order book increased 4% to £438m (2016: £421m) • Dividend per share increased by 13% Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 4 STRATEGIC REPORT Results The Board is pleased to announce strong results for the year ended 30 September 2017. These results reflect our position as a leading provider of engineering services to many of the UK\\'s critical infrastructure assets and in particular our strength in the Group revenue, including £2.2m from a joint venture, increased by 6.7% to £560.8m (2016: £525.7m) with operating profit prior to impairment, amortisation and exceptional items, increasing by 16.4% to £25.6m (2016: £22.0m), an operating margin of 4.6% The BOARD LOOKS FORWARD WITH CONFIDENCE TO THE GROUP CONTINUING TO DELIVER FURTHER STRONG FINANCIAL RESULTS.\" Chairman\\'s statement Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Renew Holdings plc 5 People Safety remains a top priority and the commitment of our employees In Specialist Building, the Group focuses on the High Quality Residential market in London and the Home Counties where we have particular skills in major engineering structural works to extend or reconfigure high value properties. Outlook The Group is well positioned for the 2017/18 financial year. Bank debt will have been completely repaid by 31 March 2018. After accounting for impairment, amortisation and exceptional items of £8.9m (2016: £3.0m), operating profit was £16.2m (2016: £18.6m) resulting in an operating margin of 3.6% (2016: 4.3%). Our Engineering Services order book grew 4% in the period to £ environmental In Water, we have seen increased activity in the current AMP6 investment period. Major frameworks include the Sewerage Repairs and Maintenance Framework for Northumbrian Water and the Civils and EMI Capital Delivery Partners Framework for Wessex Water. For Welsh Water, we have been reappointed to the Pressurised Pipelines CP6 will focus on both maintenance and renewals on the rail network as key priorities.

Cash generation assists the Group in the fulfilment of its acquisition strategy and is a strong indicator of the strength ENVIRONMENTAL Water UK water companies, regulated by Ofwat, undertake long term investment programmes on their infrastructure networks.

The operating profit KPIs are measured on a non GAAP basis which reflect the most appropriate view of the underlying performance of the business. These measures are set out in the charts below the latest government forecast to manage the whole of the mission is £70bn (discounted at today\\'s prices), with a programme lasting until 2120. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority\\'s (\"NDA\") medium term forecasts indicate a rate of decommissioning expenditure of around £3bn per annum We remain the largest mechanical, electrical and instrumentation employer at the nuclear site in Cumbria where we have recorded our eighth year of continuous operations since a reportable lost time accident.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Renew Holdings plc 19 THE GROUP HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERTISE IN DELIVERING MAINTENANCE AND RENEWALS ACROSS WATER INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORKS.\" STRATEGIC RE The acquisition of Giffen in the period broadened our offering to Network Rail, London Underground and Train Operating Companies. By utilising the joint capabilities of AMCO and Giffen we have secured AMCO\\'s first civil engineering opportunities with London Underground. Through Giffen, the Group has five frameworks with London Underground for specialist electrical, plant and progress The installation and expansion of 4G services continues to provide the majority of our work as the market is driven by consumer demand for faster, more capable mobile connectivity. We continue to support the wireless telecoms operators in the provision of new infrastructure, the upgrade of existing networks and decommissioning of redundant assets, delivering over 40,000 Walter Lilly won the \"Contractor of the Year\" award at the Building Awards 2016 in the up to £300m category. Future focus We focus on delivering technically challenging high value projects in London and the Home Counties where our expertise and experience prove differentiators in this market with high barriers to entry many of our businesses are involved with local sporting clubs for young people, providing kit and equipment through sponsorship. Our businesses support many charities and local causes throughout the year. Shepley Engineers assists its chosen charities through fundraising events in Cumbria as well as providing time and expertise alongside direct funding in support of its local community. OUR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Renew and its subsidiary businesses strive to deliver wider social, environmental and economic benefits as well as delivering benefits to our employees, clients, supply chain and other stakeholders. We understand the responsibility of our operational activities and work hard to ensure the safety of our employees and those who To mitigate these contributory factors we have introduced a Group wide initiative \"Change = STOP\" to empower employees to take responsibility for their working environment. The initiative is supported within the subsidiary businesses as part of their individual safety programmes. Our businesses undertake continual safety training to ensure the highest levels of safe working. Shepley Engineers Limited received The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (\"RoSPA\") Order of Distinction • PPS Electrical Limited received a RoSPA Order of Distinction • West Cumberland Engineering Limited received a RoSPA Gold Medal Award • Lewis Civil Engineering Limited received a third a tax charge of £4.4m (2016: £5.3m) resulted in a profit after tax prior to amortisation and related deferred taxation for the year of £20.9m (2016: £17.1m), an increase of 22%. After deducting £8.4m (2016: £2.4m As at 30 September 2016, the deferred tax liability has been increased by £1,309,000, compared to that previously reported. During the preparation of these financial statements, the Directors also became aware of inaccuracies in the corporation tax creditor at 30 September 2016. Correcting these resulted in an £833,000 This rate is higher than the headline rate of 19% as the impairment charge of £5.8m is not a taxable item. Excluding this item, the tax rate falls to 18% which is slightly lower than the headline rate. The Group has been able to utilise some brought forward losses which Liabilities have reduced primarily due to an increase in the discount rate as a result of improving gilt yields. Similar to the Lovell Scheme, the Board has worked closely with the Trustees of the Amco Scheme, to reduce the risks associated with the liabilities of the scheme. Distributable profits The distributable profits of Renew Holdings plc are £50.9m (2016: £46.6m). The Board is recommending a final dividend of 6.0p (2016: 5.35p) per share bringing the total for the year to 9.0p (2016: 8.0p As the Group has moved progressively into engineering services markets it has fewer, but larger, clients. Key clients are Network Rail, Sellafield Ltd, National Grid, Environment Agency, CTIL, Northumbrian Water, Wessex Water and Welsh Water. Loss of any of the above could potentially affect shareholder value Andries Liebenberg, 49, was appointed to the Board on 31 March 2016. Andries is the Managing Director of Renew\\'s largest business, Amalgamated Construction Limited (\"Amco\"), and has been with the Group for over ten years.
