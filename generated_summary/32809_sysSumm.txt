Bushveld Minerals is an AIM listed mineral project development company with a portfolio of vanadium, tin and coal assets in Southern Africa, including an interest in a vanadium producing operation.While the Company's focus is on developing low cost vertically integrated vanadium operations, the Company has multiple projects organised around three commodity focused LEMUR RESOURCES • Signed a Memorandum of Understanding ("MoU") with Sinohydro Corporation Ltd ("Sinohydro") for the development of a 60MW coal fired power plant based at Lemur Resources' (a Bushveld Minerals subsidiary) Imaloto 02 Bushveld Minerals Annual Report 2017 SAKARAHA MAHABOBOBOKA ADRANOVARY TULEAR SOALARA BEZAHA BENENITRA LEMUR IMALOTO PROJECT AREA Nelspruit Maputo Johannesburg Pretoria Mokopane Polokwane Vryheid I am particularly pleased to be doing this at a transformational point in the Company's development, as we transition from a junior exploration company to a producing company.Though commodity markets have markedly recovered since the lows of 2015/16, capital markets remain challenging particularly for junior miners for whom access to capital continues to be largely constrained I am encouraged to see the prominence and attention given to the Lemur Power Project by the government, including the Presidency of Madagascar at the recent Madagascar Investment Conference hosted by the South African Government in Pretoria during mid June 2017.The power project will provide a captive market for the Imaloto that BVL has been able to pay back all the external debt and facilitate a BEE transaction for Vametco within three months of the completion of the transaction is testament to the strong balance sheet and cash generation capacity of this important asset.In acquiring Vametco, BVL has not only acquired a quality operating mine and processing facility, but It proposes greater representation of historically disadvantaged persons in procurement opportunities, shareholding, management and the board composition of mining companies.The Mining Charter has, however, since been suspended pending an outcome of legal challenges brought by the South African Chamber of Mines.An important antidote to this uncertainty, however, has to Ian Watson Non Executive Chairman " I am pleased to report that the Company has been disciplined and consistent in delivering on this strategy.Each of the three platforms has made strides in realising its objectives."06 Bushveld Minerals Annual Report 2017 0.00 2.00 4.00 6.00 8.00 1.60 9.80 02 Aug 01 Sep 01 Oct 31 Oct Consequently we have crafted a vision to build the largest, lowest cost vertically integrated vanadium company.• The largest primary vanadium platform means having the largest high grade primary vanadium resource base and the largest primary vanadium production in the world; Executing on our strategy to deliver growth Vametco is one of the cheapest primary producers of vanadium in the world.It currently has an approximate 3.5% share of global supply capacity and provides a solid platform for growing this production base.It is intended to leverage its processing capacity and broaden its product base to include vanadium chemicals, such as VRFB electroly at ZAR85.5 million (US$6.5 million) EBITDA for the first half of 2017 is already 80% higher than that of the entire 2015.Going forward BVL will leverage the solid Vametco platform, its experienced management team and the South African base to grow production volumes, drive down costs and add new vanadium products the Company investigated several opportunities and, as mentioned earlier, in 2016 negotiated and agreed, in partnership with Yellow Dragon Holdings, the purchase of a 78.8% in SMC in April 2017.Our participation in the acquisition of an operating, profitable low cost producer of vanadium at less than 10% of its replacement value I am pleased with the positive outcome of the two completed studies in respect of VRFBs; these now pave the way for pursuing the VRFB opportunity further.In addition, Bushveld Energy is developing optimal sites for large scale VRFB demonstration systems of multiple megawatt hours in south africa in parallel with building up a short to a strategy for the other two platforms – Greenhills Resources (tin) and Lemur (coal and power generation) – aimed at crystallising and realising value for our shareholders.• For Greenhills Resources Limited that strategy entails consolidating a critical mass of tin resource inventory, implementing a pilot production This will allow Greenhills Resources to attract the dedicated resources (financial and human capital) to be successful as an African focused tin and associated metals champion.Lemur Resources Limited The past year has seen significant progress in the development of Lemur's Imaloto coal project in Madagascar.the design and location of the project are such that it will immediately increase the country's power supply by 15% and be able to scale up to supply more power to new electricity users in the region in the longer term.GENERAL OPERATING ENVIRONMENT The economic environment for mining and South Africa in particular remains a challenging one During the current financial year Bushveld raised approximately £3.4 million from three separate capital raisings, as well as various warrant for share conversions by shareholders.The cash raised from these capital raises were largely used to pursue the Company's participation in the Vametco acquisition, plus associated due diligence and other expenditures, as well as CONCLUSION The year under review has been an eventful and transformational one underscored by BVL's acquisition of the Vametco primary vanadium mine and processing plant.This has reflected in a 641% surge in the Company's share price from 1.53p to 9.80p between 1 August 2016 and 31 The approach recognises the need for commodities with sound economic outlook, projects with a low cost proposition and a clear path to production (and thus generating cash flows) while possessing scalability attributes.This philosophy is core to the Company's strategy in developing projects and is encapsulated below: A clear model for long term growth Bushveld's vanadium assets offer a low cost proposition due to the high in situ grades, open cast mining methodology and access to existing brownfield processing infrastructure.BVL's Vametco operation has the lowest all in production cost of any primary vanadium producer.The acquisition of Vametco Alloys by By adding the downstream thermal coal power generation project (initial capacity of 60MW), the integrated project is set to deliver power at a competitive rate, cheaper than most other sources of power in Madagascar.The power project has modest estimated capex of US$200m.Its development will be enabled in partnership with Sinohydro • World's largest primary vanadium resource base • Tier 1 vanadium grades (>2% V 2 O 5 in magnetite) • Easy access to existing infrastructure Nitrovan TM Production • Producing trademark Nitrovan TM & modified vanadium oxide products for the steel industry Vanadium Chemicals • Manufacturing capacity for chemicals Post year end BVL completed the acquisition of Strategic Minerals Corporation, which owns 78.8% of Vametco's parent company, Vametco Holdings (Proprietary) Limited.
