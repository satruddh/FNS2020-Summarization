Chairman Mannequin House The Board is keen to retain the benefit of Mark's valuable knowledge and experience and the intention is that, following the transition, the Board will look at how this might be achieved, including the option of him becoming a Non Executive Director of Watkin Jones.After 15 years at the helm, the Board understands Mark's desire to relinquish has it provided the benefits you hoped for?A: Yes, without a doubt.It has raised our profile with clients, with the supply chain and in recruitment.Our people can see the value of their contribution and it has given them a sense of ownership, which means there is more challenge in the business We only commit small sums of working capital to schemes and we have a three year pipeline, which gives us flexibility to change direction quickly.Finally, a lot of university owned PBSA was built pre 1999 and will continue to deteriorate.The universities are looking to the private sector to enhance their offer, which will
