• a commitment to the development of privately financed • infrastructure; the ability to form relationships with strong supply chain • partners, preferably companies we have worked with before; the likelihood of target financial returns management and enhancement of our investment portfolio For John Laing, being an active investor means not only participating actively in consortiums at the bidding stage, but also being actively involved in the project during the construction phase in order to protect the value of our investment and provide advice and/or assistance when delays occur or problems arise our year end portfolio value, including the shareholding in JLEN, was £1,193.8 million (31 December 2016 – £1,175.9 million).The portfolio value decreased by £142.8 million as a result of cash flows in the year, with proceeds from realisations and cash yield received from project companies partly offset by cash invested in projects the percentage of our portfolio value attributable to UK investments has fallen from 58% at 31 December 2014 to 34% at 31 December 2017.Profit before tax Our profit before tax was £126.0 million in 2017, compared to £192.1 million in 2016.Profit before tax is primarily driven by the fair value movement on our investment portfolio the principal objective behind this revised structure is to enable us to focus more effectively on value creation in each region, while allowing our business to scale up.I visited our international offices regularly during 2017.We are lucky to have high quality individuals and experienced teams across our business and it is my privilege to thank them for all they have done this year.PRIMARY INVESTMENT OUR PRIMARY INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES ARE FOCUSED ON GREENFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS.These are principally those awarded under PPP programmes as well as renewable energy assets and may also include similar long term infrastructure projects Asia Pacific – the New Grafton Correctional Centre in New • South Wales reached financial close in June 2017 with an investment commitment of £79.3 million.and this was followed by an investment commitment in December 2017 of £43.1 million to the Melbourne Metro project.
