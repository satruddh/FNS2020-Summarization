Sareum Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Building Value through Drug Development and Licensing Validating our business model Sareum's small molecule drug discovery expertise generates value and revenues by developing drug candidates, focused on cancer and autoimmune diseases, and licensing them to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies • £1.50 million received from Sierra Oncology as the Company's share of the US$7 million upfront payment from the out licensing agreement for SRA737 (September 2016).Milestone payment of £450k received (share of US$2 million payment) following the successful transfer of the two ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials of August Aurora+FLT3 patent grant notifications received for China and Hong Kong.May Sierra Oncology announced that patents protecting SRA737 were granted in the USA and Europe, extending its protection period to 2033 in the USA September SRA737 (formerly CCT245737), a novel TYK2 kinase – targeting autoimmune diseases and cancer TYK2 is a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family with roles in pro inflammatory responses in autoimmune diseases and tumour cell proliferation in certain cancers.Sareum has an ongoing co development agreement with SRI International to develop TYK2 inhibitors in autoimmune diseases and retains commercialisation rights for these and other TYK2 inhibitors for oncology and immuno oncology applications.Autoimmune and inflammatory disorders Sareum has shown with several TYK2 inhibitors promising and potentially superior therapeutic profiles 3 Sareum made important progress during the year ended 30 June 2017 across its key development programmes.The highlight of the year was the signing of a licence agreement for the Chk1 programme with Sierra Oncology, Inc (NASDAQ: SRRA).This agreement has brought a highly committed and well funded partner, with proven experience in oncology drug development the TYK2 programme has made encouraging progress during the period and candidate selection studies for both autoimmune and cancer indications are expected to commence in the first half of 2018, while the Aurora+FL T3 programme is advancing through preclinical development despite some delays.Financial review From a financial perspective, continued efficient capital use and the receipt of licensing income has resulted in this includes the selection of clinical candidates in its TYK2 programmes in both autoimmune diseases and cancer indications, expected in 2018, and further preclinical progress anticipated in the Aurora+FLT3 programme.The Company continues to engage with potential partners with a view to securing commercial licences for its products and programmes.The trial aims to identify a dose for Phase 2 studies along with preliminary efficacy to determine potential patient selection strategies for further clinical development.The combination study is exploring the potentiating effects of low dose gemcitabine (a chemotherapy that causes replication stress and DNA damage) in combination with SRA737, also in patients with genetically SRA737 – Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) Targeting solid tumours, licensed to Sierra Oncology SRA737 (formerly CCT245737) is a potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Chk1, a key regulator of SRA737 is being evaluated by Sierra Oncology in two innovative Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer and tumours identified to have genetic aberrations (mutations) that are thought to confer sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition.Tumour cells can have many genetic mutations and several of these may result in a strong reliance on " Sierra Oncology is advancing next generation DDR therapeutics for the treatment of patients with cancer, and SRA737 is its lead candidate."We are very pleased with the progress made across our pipeline during the period.The licensing of SRA737 is an important milestone for several reasons: it places the clinical development and future marketing of this exciting oncology candidate in the hands Sareum is developing potent and selective, orally available TYK2 inhibitors with potential best in class profiles that have shown initial proof of concept in in vivo models of: • Psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis; and • T cell Acute Lympho in disease models, Sareum's compounds demonstrate good oral bioavailability, were well tolerated, presented good exposure to plasma and tumour tissue, and showed a dose dependent effect on a biomarker of TYK2 inhibition and tumour reduction of up to 80%.Further formulation work, which is causing additional delays, is ongoing to complete the toxicology studies, with Sareum funding some studies in the UK to accelerate the resolution of these formulation issues.The Company is now targeting completion of the preclinical studies in the second half of 2018.Separately during the period, the Company's intellectual To date this has been done through its drug discovery platform, SKIL ® (Sareum Kinase Inhibitor Library), where new compounds targeting cancer and autoimmune diseases are identified.Preclinical development Safety toxicology, formulation and quality control studies are performed in the laboratories of CROs.£2.30 million £2.30 million 2017 £1.25 million 2016 • Increase potential success rate • Mitigate development risk • Minimise ongoing development risk • Move up value chain • Potential for higher deal values • Spread financial cost and risk • Access specialist research and development expertise Approach Benefit Pursue multiple programmes Seek collaboration partners Develop programmes to preclinical/ early clinical development Intellectual property protection is fundamental to our strategy of developing novel drug candidates and underpins our R&D programmes and we invest appropriately in this area.We are exploiting our SKIL platform, which already has a strong patent position through a number of granted and pending applications.IP considerations form a crucial part of due diligence when Stephen also currently holds the position of Chairman at Liverpool ChiroChem and is a Non executive Director at Silence Therapeutics plc.Dr Tim Mitchell, aged 57, has over 25 years' experience in the industry with key management and business expertise gained from his positions at Cambridge Discovery Chemistry Ltd and his roles at Stephen Parker DPhil Non executive Chairman John Reader PhD Founder and CSO Tim Mitchell PhD Founder and CEO GOVERNANCE Sareum Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 12 The Directors present the Strategic report of the Company and the Group for the year ended 30 June 2017.Principal activities The principal activities of the The Directors acknowledge that there is uncertainty concerning the outcome of the UK's negotiations to exit the EU but do not currently consider that this represents a significant risk to the Group's prospects.The Directors address these uncertainties by reviewing reports on scientific progress, business development and financial status at the monthly Board meetings and implementing alternative plans to reduce the risks Financial instruments Details regarding the Group's use of financial instruments and their associated risks are given in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.Statement of Directors' responsibilities The Directors are responsible for preparing the Group Strategic report, the Report of the Directors and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
