and second, the control of the end to end Our franchisees also differentiate themselves from delivery service companies by offering full employment terms to drivers rather than flexible contracts.Food costs, particularly dairy, are volatile in nature.Supply capacity inevitably lags price moves both up and down, thus exaggerating any movements in the market.after 81 new openings in 2016, our franchise partners opened a further 95 in 2017.With 1,045 stores now across the UK, we are confident of reaching our target of 1,600.Around two thirds of new store openings are coming in existing territories, where franchisees are realising the significant customer service and financial benefits of splitting territories this is partly a result of the promotional nature of pizza delivery pricing: published menu prices appear high relative to some alternatives, but in fact in 2017, 87% of our orders in the UK were on some kind of promotion, and the average discount was 38%.As a result, many customers are still left with the false perception our major web releases throughout the year focused on continuous improvement to the customer journey, reducing page load times and adding functionality such as saved card details and previous baskets.For the full year, 75.2% of sales by value were ordered online, up from 71.8% in 2016.Throughout Domino's, the customer service benefits The growth in the overall system creates a virtuous circle.Franchisees contribute 4% of sales to the National Advertising Fund, which we then invest in brand marketing on their behalf, to drive both brand values and specific promotions.These investments drive greater sales, underpinning returns on new store openings for franchisee the combination of like for like sales growth with the procurement benefits of our scale saw franchisee EBITDA per store (excluding the impact of splitting territories) maintained year on year at just over £150,000.this figure remains significantly ahead of the average from 2011 2013, and provides a typical payback on a new store opening of around three years.the margin generated within the Domino's system from being vertically integrated from dough manufacture, through value added food and non food distribution, to our own ordering platform and franchisees' stores, allows both the Group and our franchisees to make excellent returns.the rapid growth over the last few years and our future plans have led to our International Our controlled operations now comprise four markets: Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden and our associate in Germany.In each of these markets we see a clear opportunity to build strongly profitable businesses with local scale, adapted to their markets but leveraging our proven expertise in supply chain, digital and franchisee management.During the year we opened a further two stores, taking the total to 23.In December 2017 we announced our intention to acquire a further 44.3% stake in Domino's Iceland, taking our ownership to 95.3%.The transaction was completed in January 2018.Norway Our expansion in Norway accelerated significantly in 2017 with the acquisition of I'd like to extend my thanks and appreciation to all of them for their continued commitment.Outlook I remain confident in the outlook for the Group, and the year has started in line with our expectations.It is not an accident that pizza is the most successful delivered food in the world.it is quick to make fresh, travels well while SWITZERLAND TOTAL SALES (52 week basis) £19m +17.1% ICELAND TOTAL ANNUALISED SALES £40m +10.8% NORWAY TOTAL ANNUALISED SALES £38m +8.4% SWEDEN TOTAL STORES 6 CORPORATE 'DPI') assigns an exclusive ten year Master Franchise Agreement to the Group in each country.
