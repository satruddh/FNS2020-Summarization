plc has strategic interests in key hydrocarbon licences in Cameroon.It currently has a 25% interest in an offshore, shallow water permit in Etinde and a 100% interest in Bomono, an onshore permit.Where We Operate The West African state of Cameroon has an established hydrocarbon industry with a history of oil production from the Rio del Rey Basin.The Group has strategic equity interests in two permits in Cameroon, the offshore shallow water Etinde Permit (non operated) and the Onshore Bomono Per the Group is well placed financially to progress its existing asset base.The prolonged downturn in the industry is creating opportunities for Bowleven by providing the ability to access lower development costs for its assets and to continue to challenge cost efficiency in the investment cycle.With its robust financial position, Bowleven is in an ideal position to capitalise on these opportunities as they arise The Board has strongly supported the turnaround agenda, and within a short period, the Company right sized its cost base, initiated a more disciplined approach towards capital allocation and retained the capacity to deliver meaningful progress in its Etinde and Bomono assets.With a small central team we have been able to leverage our stakeholder relationships the potentially transformational Etinde appraisal drilling campaign during 2018 will enable us to further define the asset monetisation route for this potentially world class asset.The operating model is fit for purpose and I look forward to FY2018 and beyond as we grow shareholder value.Eli Chahin Chief Executive Officer 7 November 2017 Near T erm Business Objectives Maximise the value We have a potentially world class asset in Etinde where resources discovered to date will already support commercial development but which has the potential following appraisal drilling success to deliver even greater commercial opportunities.The impact for the business could be transformational and value accretive.We have an unleveraged balance sheet, strong cash position and are carried for two appraisal drills The Company is also focused on building capability and skills in the local community through the provision of employment.There have been no employee disputes, strikes, local community actions or unauthorised access which interrupted activities in Cameroon in the period of this review.An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment has been independently conducted for the Bomono development and this involved stakeholder engagement With agreement from the Cameroonian authorities that the appraisal drilling programme is to proceed, the Etinde JV plans to undertake the drilling in 2018 will ensure that Etinde's potential can be determined.The plan to commence appraisal drilling in 2018 will ensure that Etinde's potential can be determined and a full cycle project valuation presented this exercise shows that there is 146 bcf of un risked gas initially in place (GIIP) in the Bomono permit area.As of the end of October 2017, other than routine checks on the integrity of the wellheads, all activities in Bomono have ceased and the leased accommodation blocks used for drilling for the IM field, the contingent resources estimates are now reported as sales gas, primary and secondary condensate recovery and LPG recovery resources respectively.• For the purpose of calculating barrels of oil equivalent, 1 boe = 6,000 scf gas.• The contingent resource for Etinde will be updated following the appraisal drilling This is in line with our belief that businesses need to 'give back' to the community.Bowleven is always looking at ways it can be part of the initiatives that support Company projects and help the community overall.Community Events —
