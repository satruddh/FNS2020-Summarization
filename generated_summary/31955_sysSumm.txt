Observatory of Economic Complexity 20% automotive industry's contribution to exports Ashmore's investment processes deliver strong performance across market cycles Ashmore's investment processes are managed by committees, reducing the risk of performance being associated with or influenced by any individual portfolio manager.The rigorous implementation of the processes over more than 25 years has delivered consistent outperformance for clients across the ongoing improvements in economic and political fundamentals across Emerging Markets compare favourably with the structural growth challenges in the developed world, and provide substantial opportunities for Ashmore to continue to deliver value for clients and shareholders.Emerging Markets backdrop Index returns across the main Emerging Markets asset classes were strong over the year to 30 June 2017 this presents a significant medium term growth opportunity, as investors should raise allocations towards benchmark weights, and those benchmarks increasingly reflect the growing relevance of Emerging Markets within the world's economy and capital markets.Financial performance Reflecting the growth in assets under management, the Group's net revenue increased by 11% year on year Strategic and business developments There are several prominent themes that will affect the asset management industry over the medium term, including the increase in passive investing in certain markets, continual regulatory developments, and, partly in response to some of the perceived challenges, the industry has seen some consolidation activity.as emerging nations continue to grow more rapidly than developed countries, and their capital markets increase their representation in global markets and benchmark indices, the pressure on investors to address this underweight position will increase.this situation is amplified by the relative value arguments in favour of Emerging Markets, with attractive yields and equity valuations contrasting with while many of the businesses are at an early stage of development, the network spans seven countries, represents a meaningful proportion of Ashmore's employees including investment professionals, and contributes approximately 5% of Group AuM.The local businesses are performing as expected, with good growth in AuM, revenues and profits Clients Ashmore has a high quality, diversified client base that is largely institutional but with a growing contribution from retail clients accessed through intermediaries such as private banks, broker dealers and wirehouses.Client relationships are managed by a 40 strong distribution team that is located throughout Ashmore's worldwide office network Brexit In March 2017, the UK formally started the process to leave the European

of Emerging Markets The long term growth opportunity across Emerging Markets is significant and is in contrast to the structural growth impediments facing many Developed Markets.Emerging Markets generate 58% of world GDP and this share is expected to rise steadily as the 87% of the world' this resilience can be attributed to Emerging Markets' stronger fundamentals, such as low debt levels, inflation targeting by central banks, the establishment of domestic pension funds, greater prevalence of floating exchange rates with high levels of foreign exchange reserves, high savings and investment rates, room to ease both fiscal and monetary policies, better demographic Active management can mitigate the risks There are risks to this optimistic outlook, but the major systemic risks to Emerging Markets, such as a decline in commodity prices and US dollar strength, have already been endured and have been largely managed well by the majority of Emerging Markets countries.2010 2011
