Board and my Group Executive management team, to update the Group's strategy for delivering long term, sustainable growth.Our strategy for creating shareholder value is based upon three key elements: • grow the core by maximising organic sales growth from our current product portfolio • pursue selective organic product In the US in particular, our leading product technologies for Law Enforcement departments are setting Avon Protection apart and enabling us to continue to grow our market share.Over the mid term we expect market share gains to continue.To cross sell a broader range of CBRN systems, we look forward to launching our US powered air range once Precision, Control and Intelligence (PCI) Leverage our dominant market position in Interface to maximise cross sales of our PCI range of products.Complete the development of the control and intelligence product ranges to meet the regional requirements for the geographies that we serve.Farm Services Continue to build on the success of Cluster Exchange Acquisitions are intended to complement and extend the reach of our existing businesses.This will have the effect of building a more robust and diversified business, albeit within our existing markets.We have a strong balance sheet including net cash of £24.7m, together with committed bank facilities of £29.9m and a cash within Avon Protection we expect initial orders for the M53A1 powered air respirator and M69 aircrew respirator programmes in 2018, with these orders offsetting the non recurrence of the 37,000 FM50 general purpose respirator order and anticipated lower M50 mask systems deliveries to the US DoD during 2018.In the medium term these programmes together with MILITARY Military revenue of £68.2m (2016: £62.3m) was up 9.5% due to favourable currency movements.On a constant currency basis, Military revenues were flat versus last year with the 37,000 FM50 general purpose respirator order offsetting lower DoD revenues.
