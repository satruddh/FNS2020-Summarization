Independent auditors' Our vision C4XD is committed to becoming the world's most productive Drug Discovery Engine, supplying the pharmaceutical industry with a sustainable source of commercially attractive drug assets.We commit our resources to the early discovery of novel therapeutic targets for high value disease areas and generate new drug molecules against these targets rather than competing with others by the pharmaceutical industry's demand for high quality, early stage drug candidates continues to grow and we are poised to take advantage of this growing trend by continuing to build a focussed commercial function that continually monitors the landscape for licensing opportunities.We only pursue new programmes in areas of high unmet medical need that are commercially attractive and focus on generating long term partnerships During the year we have strengthened our financial position through the raising of a total of £12 million and added a wealth of knowledge and experience to our Board with Brad Hoy and Dr Craig Fox joining as Directors.We continue to build towards becoming a significant self sustaining business and look forward to further progress in the coming period in delivering on successful fundraises In September 2016, we completed a £5 million fundraise at 102 pence per share bringing in several new investors, including Calculus Capital Limited and Polar Capital LLP.In March 2017 we completed a £7.0 million fundraise at 85 pence per share bringing in several new investors our pre clinical candidate molecule, an oral selective Orexin 1 receptor antagonist, remains on schedule to be ready for clinical development by the end of 2017.Following completion of a successful 4.2Kg GMP manufacturing campaign of drug substance, the in life phase of the pivotal GLP toxicology studies have been completed with the subsequent pathological analysis During 2017, we have extended our initial exciting results on understanding the genetic basis of this disorder and confirmed these discrete patient sub groups.Using a US dataset, we have now found an additional 67 genetic variants not previously associated with PD, complementing the 47 novel genetic variants identified in our initial study GSK has filed several further patents on their molecules against this target in the last 12 months and is likely to be close to clinical development.Recently, C4XD' s lead compounds have been shown to significantly increase NRF 2 activation in the lungs in pre clinical studies following oral administration.T wo of these drug targets were nominated for evaluation as potential new pipeline programmes and the first of these targets has progressed into the hit to lead stage of discovery with molecules showing activity in a disease relevant cell system.Opportunistic programmes Immuno oncology C4XD' s Drug Discovery Engine is currently being used to target two key therapeutic targets for the Conformetrix data platform development including VR (virtual reality) visualisation C4XD' s novel drug design platform "Conformetrix" determines the 3D shapes of drug molecules from experimental data giving medicinal chemists new and unprecedented insights into the behaviour and physical properties of drug molecules.It may take longer than anticipated for the Group' s technology to identify drug candidates that are commercially and technically attractive to pharmaceutical company collaborators.Market and competition Alternative competing technologies and products could emerge that might displace the market opportunity for drug candidates discovered by the Group.Intellectual property The success of C4XD' s technology depends in part upon Review of the business and future developments C4XD continues to progress its proprietary programmes and focus its activities on the delivery of its strategic ambitions and acquiring complementary technologies.Grant income received by the Group is netted off administrative expenses and is not included within revenue.Brexit C4XD has considered the potential impact of Brexit on the cash position reflects the £5 million and £7 million raised via placings in September 2016 and March 2017 respectively as detailed in the CEO's Statement.Both cash and costs continue to be prudently managed.Brad Hoy Chief Financial Officer 14 December 2017 Results Revenue for the 12 months
