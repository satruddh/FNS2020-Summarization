total of €82m Since then we have carried out many improvements to our process which enabled us to increase capacity from the same two chemical reactors.As a result this year, we sold 39,790 cubic meters of Accoya, an 18% increase compared to last year, and 60% more than was even thought possible 10 years ago The plant is expected to be EBITDA positive operating at 40% capacity.During the year we have also made significant progress with the expansion of our Accoya plant in Arnhem, from its current capacity of approximately 40,000 cubic meters to 60,000 cubic meters per annum in the first of a two part expansion Underlying EBITDA improved from €1.6m loss in the first half of the year to €0.4m profit in the second half as a result of higher licensing income and sales volumes.Balance sheet

available in early 2018 calendar year.Demand for Accoya continues to increase and we expect sales to grow further thereafter.Patrick Shanley Non executive Chairman 19 June 2017 " I BELIEVE WE HAVE NOW REACHED A S • Tricoya Consortium established to build, operate and run Tricoya plant in Saltend, Hull • Planning allows for future expansion • Pre construction, engineering and design work completed in 2016 • Engie Fabricom appointed as Engineering, Procurement and Construction ('EPC') contractor • Tricoya chips to our technology Accoya® is based upon our proprietary wood acetylation technology.The physical properties of any material are determined by its chemical structure.Wood contains an abundance of chemical groups called 'free hydroxyls'.Free hydroxyl groups absorb and release water according to changes in the climatic conditions to The Group is focused on the higher value end of these applications, where the dual qualities of durability and dimensional stability offered by Accoya are most highly valued.The majority of our Accoya sales is to a network of timber distributors which in turn supply a variety of industries, principally for joinery (windows and
