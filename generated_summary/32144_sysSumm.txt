strategic allocation ranges.The Income pool is also below its target, though we do not feel under pressure to rectify this with markets at The US holdings, such as Microsoft, Philip Morris, Becton Dickinson and Flowserve, were notable performers, as was Jardine Matheson, which operates predominantly in Southeast Asia.We sold our holdings in Close Brothers and LondonMetric Property, amongst others.The undoubted highlight was the sale of our 81.5% stake in Park Holidays to Intermediate Capital Group.We received cash proceeds of £197m which, when added to dividends received, represented 2.9x our original investment and an IRR of 44%.This company was a good fit with The existing Unquoted pool portfolio has traded broadly in line with budget during the year.Of particular note is the
