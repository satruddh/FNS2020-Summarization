selecting how and where we promote ourselves.The audience we seek to attract is knowledgeable about the markets, financially astute Earlier this year we raised our required wealth bands, and first time clients must now place an increased opening balance on their account before they begin trading.As far as possible, our aim is always to ensure that the prospects our advertising attracts are right for us, and that our products are right for them In recognition of our commitment to clients, and to ensure we're delivering 'best practice' service, last year we became members of the Institute of Customer Service.This enabled us to have our service standards independently appraised and verified by the UK based organisation.MARKET LEADING TECHNOLOGY Likewise, our extensive collection of online how to videos is accessible at any time to help clients enhance their knowledge.Earlier this year we also acquired DailyFX – the world's leading portal for forex research, trading news, charts,

grassroots to Board level • To foster a culture that values employees' commitment and celebrates their success We're proud of our working culture Where existing employees become disabled, temporarily or permanently, it's our policy to provide continuing employment wherever practicable in the same or an alternative position.Appropriate training and/or graduated back to work programmes, in conjunction with the occupational health professionals, help achieve this aim.Wellbeing We're fully committed to the health and wellbeing In 2016 we adjusted some of our salary ranges to ensure we remain competitive.While we acknowledge a possible influence from external factors such as Brexit, we believe that our proactive approach has positively affected attrition.As well as offering a market related salary structure that is regularly benchmarked, we include the majority of our employees in a group We encourage all of our employees to take responsibility for their own development while they're with us.However, we recognise that resources need to be in place to enable this to happen.
