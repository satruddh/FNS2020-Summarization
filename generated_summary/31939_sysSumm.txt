announced the two year renewal of its contract with Toshiba Global Commerce Solutions for the use of the AIR platform within Asda that integrates with existing Asda Walmart POS solutions across Asda

way that businesses engage with consumers.Traditional and analogue forms of promotions, rewards and loyalty The Group will leverage his experience to ensure first class operations and delivery across

increased 10% to 44.4m (2016: 40.3m), as a result of messaging for Asurion and the cross selling of messaging services to the existing client base.3.Deepen We have made significant progress in

(2016: £5.9m), including capitalised intellectual property of £2.2m (2016: £2.2m) and cash of £3.7m Revenue from Tier 1 clients in the UK increased by 92% to £3.3m (2016: £1.7m).This growth was also

stream, the element specifically linked to however, the pace of progress of the development projects may not be as expected and the Group could fail to meet its customers' timing or performance requirements.As a result of these risks, the Group may lose customers, may become liable to those customers for damages and may suffer damage to its reputation.Dependence on key customers The Group is dependent on a number of key contracts and partner relationships for its current and future growth and development.A limited number of clients account for a large percentage of the Group's revenue.Whilst the Group endeavours to enter and renew long term agreements with its clients, there can be no assurance The technology used in the Group's products is still evolving and is highly complex and may change rapidly.Research and development by other companies may render any of the Group's products in development, or currently available, obsolete.This risk is primarily mitigated by the quality of the technical staff recruited.If the Group fails to obtain adequate access to, or protection for, the intellectual property required to pursue its strategy, the Group's competitors may be able to take advantage of the Group's research and development efforts.
