GOVERNANCE 26—72 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 73—123 COMPANY at some point in the future we will see this figure inevitably approaching 100%.We are planning now for the investment and transformation required to keep pace with this digital evolution.Maximising our potential Broadly speaking, our businesses have operated on a standalone basis over the last few years, with little focus on Group synergies The paper catalogues used by both businesses will remain a key element of our marketing for some time, as that's what our customers tell us that they want.However, we also know that increasingly they want to shop areas where goods are manufactured.By revisiting that opportunity, Findel Education has identified a number of new suppliers who can provide better Phil

Executive's Review I Strategic Findel Education continued to see challenging market conditions, with price competition for the commodity based School brands being particularly intense and leading to a further loss in market share.It did, however, manage to regain lost customers for its Classroom and Specialist brands.Importantly, it completed its warehouse consolidation project on time, on budget and without disruption Key proposition elements: – Value – Personalisation – Integrated credit Express Gifts – Delivering sustainable growth in revenue and customer numbers – Enhancing our overall offer to the customer to increase our share of their spending – Ensuring that treating customers fairly is at the heart of the business – Migrating Key Investment Features 1.A strong record of increasing the customer base and improving product sales.2.Ongoing buying and supply chain efficiency improvements help to deliver better value to our customers whilst sustaining margins.3.Already on a digital transformation with 63% of sales made online.4.Investment in new systems and a strengthened management team will enable us to offer Express Gifts is an online and catalogue value retailer and trades through two key brands (Studio and Ace).Both brands offer customers a broad range of fashion, home and leisure items, toys and gifts at affordable prices.Its inhouse personalisation facility, its focus on everyday value, combined with a flexible credit it typically takes around 18 months to recoup the investment in new customer recruitment due to a combination of the initial marketing cost itself, a relative high bad debt charge compared to an established customer, and a lower initial credit line from which we can earn financial services income.As a result, the increased recruitment activity, especially towards the end To deliver these will require changes to: • People: transform the culture and organisation to have the capability to operate in a customer focused, digital world... • Process: remove the non value tasks to enable us to focus on doing the right things well 'efficient and effective'... • Technology: continued investment in our systems – focus on modern, flexible and agile Product development Express Gifts has had a strong heritage in gifts, Christmas decorations, cards and accessories, but has moved over recent years to offer a broader appeal through clothing, homewares and electricals.It was encouraging to see clothing grow by 44%, but it still represents 28% of total sales, presenting a significant opportunity We have made good progress already, with nearly £8m already returned to customers.Financial income received during FY17 increased by 12.6% on a like for like basis*, due to the increase in product sales plus the introduction towards the end of FY16 of "Risk Based Pricing" where the rate of interest charged to since its opening, we have seen service levels (measured via our "net promoter score" survey) increase steadily and we are now in a position to grow this capability further.The new websites launched at the start of the year help customers to manage enquiries online, rather than requiring telephone or email assistance for routine matters.therefore, as anticipated and seen at the half year, the adjusted bad debt charge* as a percentage of revenue therefore increased to 7.3% (FY16: 3.9%) which is within the expected range of 7 8%.The introduction of the new bad debt provisioning models led to an individually significant charge of £35.2m being recognised KPIs – measuring our progress How it is
