intentions and unique Master Developer licence model.• EPRA NAV up 7.1 per cent The core reason for establishing Urban&Civic was to provide new housing choices and accelerate supply through Master Development.In accordance with our strategy, that involves creating environments in which people actively want to live and a delivery structure that encourages speed and quality from those
