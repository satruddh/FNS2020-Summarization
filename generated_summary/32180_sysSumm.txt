of directors What we do Telford Homes Pl OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION 05 Performance Notwithstanding some uncertainty created by the outcome of the EU referendum, we have experienced robust demand for our homes from individual investors and owner occupiers.Along with monitoring external influences on the Group, the development of our build to rent strategy has been one of the principal areas of focus for the Board this year.This sector complements our historic focus on individual sales to investors and owner occupiers and is well aligned with our forward selling philosophy.06 In a year that has seen strong operational growth, our admirable health and safety record merits mention.Health and safety is the first item on the agenda at monthly Board meetings and our performance is testament to the sound policies and procedures in place, as well as the deep rooted sense of responsibility that pervades the organisation.the economic environment is proving to be robust and the economy has performed better than expected post the EU referendum vote, with the housing market remaining resilient.Demand and population growth in London There has been consistent, long term growth in London's population (see chart 2).This has led to ever growing demand for housing in the capital which has not been matched 08 Housing starts reduce There were circa 17,000 new build starts in London for the year to June 2016, down from around 25,000 in 2015 (see chart 3).This was the lowest level since 2012 and intensifies the cumulative deficit built up over decades.Tax changes The move to a tiered system of Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) in recent years has assisted the majority Approval rates have improved over the last few years since the introduction of the National Planning Policy Framework, although the process to obtain planning permission and discharge conditions can remain arduous, with the shortage of local authority planning officers a key factor.The Government's Help to Buy scheme now provides an equity loan of up to 40 per cent in BUSINESS MODEL DEVELOPING IN LONDON: AN INTEGRATED BUSINESS LAND ACQUISITION Brownfield

service together with our sustainability commitments Broadening our geographic focus within London to access more opportunities Increasing our average site size to achieve economies of scale Focusing on affordable non prime locations for open market sale homes OPERATE EFFICIENTLY ACCESS TO LAND MEETING DEMAND We have a clear plan to achieve our ambition of doubling our output both reflect the increasing mix between developments sold to individual buyers and build to rent transactions secured at lower margins in exchange for enhanced capital returns.despite uncertainty in relation to the outcome of the EU referendum and tax changes impacting primarily UK based individual investors, our underlying market has remained resilient.OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 15 KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW In February 2017, we added to the pipeline with the acquisition of a sizeable development site, the former London Electricity Board (LEB) building on Cambridge Heath we have seen robust demand from individual investors underpinned by a thriving rental market primarily caused by an imbalance between supply and demand for rental properties at the right price point.Amongst these sales it is pleasing to see a number of repeat purchasers, who often opt to wait for the launch of the next Telford Homes development rather than investing elsewhere The sale, to a subsidiary of our joint venture partner Notting Hill Housing Group, was for the first phase of open market homes at this development and removed the need for third party debt finance.As we have previously reported we are actively looking into establishing longer term relationships with build to rent investors.In any case sales to overseas investors have remained robust, evidenced by the launches of the Liberty Building just over a year ago and more recently City North.We have seen particular success over the last three years in selling to investors based in China.This is despite any potential tempering of demand in relation to leaving the EU or the additional three per cent CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW 18 We do not expect Help to Buy to become as fundamental to Telford Homes as it is to many other developers, but it will help us to maintain support for those who still wish to purchase their own home.We are planning dedicated sales centres on more of our sites, working together with our central sales location in Stratford SOUTH KILBURN NW6 Selected as the preferred partner to redevelop a 3.2 acre site Detailed planning consent for 236 homes close to Kilburn Park station Intend to start work later in 2017 with completion in 2021 Computer generated images OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENT Not only is this beneficial to our customers and investors but it also improves our return on capital.Examples include the off site construction of brick cladding at our Manhattan Plaza development and the use of a lightweight metal frame structure at The Pavilions, one of our build to rent schemes.Along with the rest of The Board has prepared an income statement and a balance sheet using proportional consolidation along with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) compliant versions presenting joint ventures as equity investments.The key performance indicators and other figures within this report include the Group's share of joint venture results.Similarly, the increase in average price is a function of the mix of developments completing in each year in terms of product and their location together with relatively modest sales price inflation.The reduction in revenue from open market completions was more than offset by an increase in both subsidised affordable housing revenue and build to rent revenue recognised in the year Similar to the two sites sold in the prior year for a total of £6.7 million, this sale is a result of a change in strategic direction where smaller sites have become less attractive to build out and the Group is able to leverage its greater operational size to focus on larger scale developments.
