of Comprehensive Income The Company is very much looking forward to taking the next generation of therapeutics into further development and through to the clinic.• VAL401 and VAL201 have received several major patent grants and the IP portfolio now covers all major areas worldwide.• VAL401 and VAL201 have received several major patent grants and the IP portfolio now covers Going forward, the Company's focus is to complete laboratory tests before progressing VAL301 to clinical trials.A particularly noteworthy achievement by the Company in the reporting period was the successful completion of the VAL401 Phase ll clinical study in patients with late stage non small cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer VAL201's patent protection now extends across territories that include US, Japan, Australia, Europe and the UK, providing coverage in the world's major markets.Another important breakthrough during the year was the development of an optimised, commercially viable second generation of the VAL101molecule derived from our proprietary GeneICE platform.The Non Executive Chairman is responsible for overseeing the running of the Board, ensuring that no individual or group dominates the Board's decision making and ensuring the Non Executive Directors are properly briefed on matters.The Chief Executive Officer has the responsibility for implementing the strategy of the Board and managing the day to day business activities How we will achieve We will achieve these goals through early detection of disease and therapeutic intervention.Reduce risk in new product development through rigorous clinical and commercial due diligence.Aim Our aim is to engineer a scientific breakthrough in human health and wellbeing.Select drug candidates and technologies with evidence based potential to address unmet market needs Continue promising testing in VAL101 ValiRx's proprietary GeneICE technology enables selective silencing of overzealous, rebellious or inappropriate activity by specific genes, which contribute to many disease states including cancers and inflammatory conditions, Alzheimer's and auto immune diseases.• The production of positive trial data showed that the VAL401 treatment had a measurable improvement on patient quality of life, in addition to a positive impact on the disease and an extension in the overall survival of patients.•

influenced by hormonal changes and respond in a way that is similar to the cells found inside the uterus and symptoms often worsen with the menstrual cycle.The treatments chosen will depend on symptoms, age, and lifestyle plans Based on these results, the design of the protocol for a Phase III study is underway.GeneICE The GeneICE "rebellious gene" technology continues to show good progress in the pre clinical phase – the programme currently benefits from a second Eurostars grant for up to £1.6m for the further development of this technology platform this data also implies the potential for VAL401, in the as yet untested combinations with, both traditional chemotherapies and immune oncology treatments.Palliative stage patients could expect to see an improvements in symptoms with VAL401 treatment, together with improved survival prospects.The Company's preclinical developments of VAL301 and VAL101 are going ahead with exciting and encouraging results.During the year, the Company's patent portfolio has been greatly strengthened with patent grants for VAL401 and VAL201 in major territories.This expanding patent protection further supports the Company's business model Rebellious genes are the ones that are working when/where they should not e.g.in cancers, inflammatory conditions, Alzheimer's and autoimmune diseases.ValiRx's proprietary GeneICE technology enables the design of compounds for selective binding and silencing of these specific genes.Prostate cancer VAL201 is a potentially major breakthrough therapeutic treatment of Advanced Prostate Cancer due to its novel mechanism of action.A number of studies have demonstrated that Src kinase complete inhibition strongly reduces prostate cancer growth but may have side effects.VAL201 specifically targets the association of androgen receptor with Our focus now is to Country Patent number Date filed Granted/Allowed United States US 14/575065 14 March 2008 Granted Europe EP 08717866.1 14 March 2008

and VAL401, a re purposed compound to treat non small cell lung cancer, through the Phase II Clinical Trial pathway.The business model is to ensure future partnering of these compounds with larger co development partners.The Group's patent applications may not be granted and its existing patent rights may be successfully challenged and revoked.The drug development process is inherently risky and is conducted over several years and consequently is costly.
