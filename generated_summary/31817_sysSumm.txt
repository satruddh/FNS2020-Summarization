A BRIGHT FUTURE Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Forward looking statements The disclosures in this Annual Report for Nanoco Group plc ("the Company") and its subsidiaries ("Nanoco" or "the Group") contain certain forwardlooking statements.01 Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 HIGHLIGHT S Display • Hybrid commercial model in display established: direct sales of own manufactured product and multiple non exclusive licences • Ten fold increase in manufacturing capacity at Runcorn and reduction in product costs • First commercial sales orders received • Substantial pipeline of commercial opportunities – focused REA SONS T O INVE S T WHERE WE DO IT PIONEER AND WORLD LEADER IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF CADMIUM FREE QUANTUM DOTS (CFQDs) EXTENSIVE PATENT PORTFOLIO, c However, significant progress has been made in developing demand for our CFQDs; an increasing number of manufacturers are now producing demonstration displays incorporating our technology and we are confident that sales will result as these move into commercial production.We are also making good progress in Life sciences and Specialised lighting.The slower than expected progress in Display and the Company' the life sciences business was awarded an Innovate UK grant.In addition, after the year end, a commercial supply and license agreement was won from a US medical device company for light therapy products for the treatment of pain, soft tissue injury and dermatological conditions such as acne and skin anti ageing.Alison brings an exceptional breadth of relevant skills to the Nanoco Board, with her background in chemistry and her extensive commercial, financial and international experience across the technology sector.Employees and shareholders On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of Nanoco's employees for their achievements during the year and for CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 07 Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 OUR GROWING DIRECT SALES PIPELINE NDA, scope and design specifications Specification agreement and development sampling Technical approval Design win First commercial sales orders Engineering samples Contract negotiation and commercial IHS Technology ("IHS") forecasts 26 million displays will be quantum dot ("QD") equipped by 2021, with more than 90% of the market cadmium free.Samsung, with its QLED brand, is leading the field and sold more than 3 million QD displays in 2016.Other than Strategic report Commercialisation continued Commercialisation – Runcorn continued We were pleased to announce in December 2016 that the Company had been awarded ISO 9001:2015 certification for our production and supply processes, underlining the robust nature of our systems.Commercialisation – Wah Hong Wah Hong, which is quoted on the Nanoco's Senior Vice President of Global Sales gave a presentation on the growing demand from manufacturers and consumers for quantum dots as a method of achieving wider colour gamut and enhanced picture quality in the next generation of displays.the trade show further validated the growing interest in state of the art TVs and monitors incorporating CFQDs to enhance colour performance Merck is actively engaged with its potential customers on various CFQD application projects and sells under the Livilux ® brand.Commercialisation – staying ahead of the technology curve In May 2017 Nanoco signed a collaboration and joint development agreement (" JDA") with Kyulux Inc.Under the agreement, Nanoco's CFQD The initial focus of the division is on illumination of cancerous tumours to facilitate their surgical removal and then, with further development, cancer diagnosis.The NLS team has made great strides in the development of safe and clinically acceptable quantum dot nanomaterials based on the Company's heavy metal free quantum dot technology This was a much needed decision, which will provide market certainty as to the end date for cadmium to be used in TVs and other display products such as monitors.The RoHS Directive recognises cadmium as the most hazardous heavy metal.We believe that this legislation should accelerate the move from cadmium to cadmium free Q Partner licensees The licences in place with Dow, Merck and Wah Hong put the Company in a strong position to have multiple routes to the display market with significant capacity capable of achieving strong growth.Operations Nanoco's core activities are the generation and development of CFQD ® quantum dot products involving the application of Customers We assist customers in exploiting the full benefit of CFQD ® quantum dot products in their displays in order to achieve wide colour gamut, energy efficiency and brightness thus significantly improving the customers' product offering.Partners We work with our partners to enable them to fully exploit our technology thereby maximising their opportunity to generate revenues the display market includes: televisions, monitors, notebooks, tablets and smartphones • Stronger demand for large ultra high definition ("UHD") and 8K panels could slow declining average selling prices • Global display demand could pick up after 2016 if global economy improves • Flat panel display ("FPD") area is expected to grow as demand for large TVs the research project that has received the grant, entitled "VIVODOTSTM nano devices for detection, resection and management of pancreatic cancers" is a continued collaboration between Nanoco and University College London ("UCL"), the Group's long time partner in the life sciences sector.builds Develop in house capability and capacity We have invested in expanding our manufacturing capacity and in house production remains a key part of our strategy.Growth Investment Performance in 2017 Whilst billings fell by £0.8 million compared to last year to £1.1 million, revenues grew by 179% compared to 2016 to £1.3 Licensed partners can bring significant extra capacity and resources to address the expected growth in the market for CFQD ® quantum dot products.Licensing Performance in 2017 During the year we transferred significant knowledge to our licensing partners to assist them in exploiting their licence to our technology.Future focus We will keep supporting our licensing partners to maximise the benefit 2015 2016 2017 £(10.6)M £(9.1)M £(9.0)M Total investment in research and development Total investment in research and development costs, including direct and indirect overheads, of all research and development activities.The successful development of complex products and technologies is the Group's core skill and defines the Group' The Group has identified, actively monitors and is taking action to mitigate many different risks.Risks are categorised as strategic, financial or operational.This section does not include them all, but focuses on those risks that the Directors believe to be the most important that are currently faced by the business.RISK DESCRIPTION POTENTIAL CAUSES AND IMPACT MITIGATION CHANGE LINK TO STRATEGY Strategic and financial
