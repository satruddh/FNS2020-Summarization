AND STRATEGY Hansteen is a leading owner and asset manager of a very FOUNDER LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP) The LTIP is based on the growth of EPRA NAV plus dividends, which was put in place for the Joint Chief Executives at the time of the initial #oatation in 2005 and which has not paid out Since then rates have approximately halved and there is a general acknowledgement that these rates are likely to stay low for longer than was hitherto expected.Such a background to the operation of a high yielding property business is outside the experience of most people working today but the likelihood must be that it will provide scope for continued yield compression Joint Chief Executive Joint Chief Executive Finance Director 9 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Joint Chief Executives'

and AIF values increased by £49.1 million or 13.1%.The value of Saltley Business Park in Birmingham, which is now owned in a 50/50 joint venture with this excellent achievement has come through a combination of letting vacant space and selling vacant units, both important components of the Hansteen business model.For the third year in a row, all three of our core regions have contributed to this increase in occupancy.The passing rent of the portfolio under management at the start of the year was £134.9 million per HSBC provided a ve year, €108 million facility which, with a €55 million

that they secure.• Hedges are implemented at levels which the Board believe are cost effective.• Hedging is employed as an insurance policy against the impact of a signi cant fall in the value of the
