train customers to use and maintain the devices safely and effectively design, it will be one which is much better than if we had simply waited at the bus stop of opportunity for something serendipitous – or not – to come along.A fact which is rarely acknowledged by observers is that the core of every company is slowly dying.This includes even the most'modern' companies such as those focusing on but exactly the same gradual attrition phenomena happens to industrial companies, consumer packaged goods companies, healthcare, transportation, energy and food.So while the rates of decline may be a little slower than in electronics markets, they are nevertheless there.Second, great companies grow faster than the markets they serve and, as a result, they steadily Smiths Group plc

(and some negative ones if a company isn't careful), but done properly, one thing acquisitions always do is to bring speed of execution of the strategic plan.The wonderful thing we can observe about growth and innovation is that it's an 'everybody wins' strategy Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2017 13 STRA TEGIC REPORT Higher growth market focus We have decided to build a much stronger focus on growing in these higher growth regions.Arithmetically, if our portfolio had the same percentage of sales in these regions as do our peers, our organic growth rate would be about 100 basis points Embracing the digital future Smiths is making significant upfront investments in digital, including in centres of excellence in the US and Europe, to make sure we are properly prepared to respond to this emerging opportunity.These technological ideas are altering the way people think about the products they buy, about marketing, communications, healthy eating, entertainment, transportation etc We made excellent progress in our pension plan and in getting the kind of leadership we need in key places around the Group.As far as innovation is concerned, there's always a longer lead time than we'd like before we see the green shoots.I know from past experience that if we continue down this innovation pathway the growth will come we saw growth across the portfolio offset by John Crane's oil & gas business and in Smiths Medical due to market challenges in John Crane and a delay in some new product launches in Smiths Medical.Group revenue grew 11% on a reported basis, benefiting from foreign exchange, and in particular the strength of the Organic growth will always be my top priority but we expect to run a carefully considered parallel path of acquisition and divestiture to accelerate our repositioning globally.An example of our work to reposition the portfolio is the focusing and restructuring of Smiths Interconnect.R E V E NUE DOWN 1% £3,280M FREE SES gives us a shared operating model that will help us to apply best practice to drive speed, efficiency and a culture of continuous improvement, right across the Group.Results are already starting to come, with around £40m in

the cutting edge.It's essential that we're technology leaders, defining new ways to bring value to our customers and developing new business models for the future we've made good progress during the year, including launching a new leadership development programme in partnership with UCLA Anderson Executive Education, a new approach to measuring employee engagement, a Group wide communication plan to help everyone understand the part they play, and the adoption of our new 'Smiths Way' of working.CHIE F F INAN CIAL O F F I CE R'S R E V IE W O U R F IN A N C I A L S T R AT EG Y I S D E S I G NE D
