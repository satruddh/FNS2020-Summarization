years early and met our net debt targets.We are seeing encouraging signs of progress in our customer facing businesses.In our next phase to 2020, we will further shift investment towards those businesses and focus on performance delivery, specifically growing gross margin This must all necessarily be executed at pace, because to stand still in our fast moving sector is to invite obsolescence, and because our employees understandably want to get to the other side as quickly as possible.There is a palpable desire within Centrica to find new ways of accelerating cultural change, building innovative capabilities and better meeting our customers' expectations at Chairman's Statement Our vision is clear, our determination is unshakeable, our governance is robust and we are confident that we will return Centrica to real and sustainable growth.Chairman's Statement Our vision is clear, our determination is unshakeable, our governance is robust and we are confident that we will return Centrica to real and sustainable growth The risk management framework makes a positive contribution to good decision making and business growth and will be even stronger for the lessons learnedt last year.Your Board discussed all aspects of our perceived risk exposure, with particular emphasis on process safety, political pressures, strategic delivery, cyber security, capability development and leadership succession.but, pending its adoption, your Board decided that discretion should be exercised under the current policy to reflect recent events, even though a significant portion of the impact was beyond the control of the Executive team.Accordingly, no annual bonuses or pay rises were awarded to the Executive Directors for 2017 and, provided the new Remune To that end, we in particular need to focus more on our weakest performance if we are truly to improve customer experience levels and open up the powerful possibility of our customers becoming our advocates.This is the most reliable route to dealing with the trust gap that confronts business as a whole and the energy supply sector in particular Group Chief Executive's Statement This, combined with uncertainty around our future prospects in UK energy supply, significantly amplified by the Prime Minister's announcement in October that the UK Government would pursue a market wide price cap of the Standard Variable Tariff (SVT) and other default tariffs, resulted in a significant fall in It is founded on an analysis of market trends and sources of growth, on our own capabilities and the efficiency necessary to pursue them profitably.Centrica is an energy and services company.Our purpose is 'to provide energy and services to satisfy the changing needs of our customers'.This is the core of the Company and we have been supplying energy and Our development of Hive, starting with the digital thermostat and the intelligent boiler, is the next phase in the evolution of home energy management and a direct extension of our in home services business.We are finding that consumers want these propositions and are willing to pay for them.We are also finding that many customers value receiving these services from the same provider as their 700,000 customers have so far signed up for British Gas Rewards, enabling us to enhance the relationship and proposition for our loyal customers in combination with our other offers.In our customer businesses, our goal is to focus on value, not volume, retaining and engaging our customers while continuing to drive costs down to maintain margins our current SVT is cheaper than 85% of the market and is £41 a year below the average SVT of the large suppliers.Thirdly, our efficiency programme will deliver an additional estimated saving of £20 per dual fuel customer by 2020.Taking all of this together, and recognising that the formula for any potential cap is not yet subject to ensuring alignment with our partner, and being very mindful of UK Government interests in this area, we would hope to achieve this by the end of 2020.The business customer is also on the move and we are responding to their needs.They want more than just commodity energy supply, and the new capabilities and propositions we have developed once again reinforce the core of We would be open to having a lower ownership percentage in a larger entity, provided our net E&P exposure remains broadly unchanged and we retain sufficient influence to shape the strategic direction of the business.We would therefore also be prepared to own less than 50% of Spirit Energy if the right opportunity came along.In performance terms, it is about growing gross margin through our customer relationships, and driving the next phase of cost efficiency.We will also be focusing on improving organisational effectiveness and securing the capabilities we need in 2020 and beyond.We must do all of this while continuing to deliver improvements in safety, compliance and conduct and in operational excellence across We would intend to restore a progressive dividend only when, in addition to the criteria already mentioned, underlying cash flow growth capability is demonstrated.The transformation of Centrica is also about the values which guide us as we go about our daily business.In 2017 we launched a new set of Group wide values – 'our Values' of Care, Collaboration, Courage this is how we will rebuild shareholder value and confidence, and I am determined to demonstrate this through our actions, one step at a time.
