Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2 Strategic Report Highlights of the Year Steady progress Key Events Total 2017 production of 272,274 oz of gold and gold equivalent, above the guidance range for the year of 255,000 – 265,000 oz.(2016 production new JORC compliant reserve estimate at MNV doubled ore reserves and supported the extension of life of mine by four years to at least 2022, with initial results from the ongoing near mine exploration programme indicating resources for additional years of operation.New exploration licences were received for two areas adjacent to MNV.Total production of gold and gold equivalent is expected to be in the range of 265,000 – 275,000 oz.MNV – To continue extensive near mine exploration programme and publish an updated JORC compliant reserve estimate in Q3 2018.Novo – To proceed with construction work on the mine expansion and design ** 2016 net cash inflow from operations was amended for US$3.1 million reclassified to the investing activities.*** Net debt is defined as cash and cash equivalent, decreased by interest bearing loans and borrowings and by liability under finance lease.Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 4 K before I chronicle such progress, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, after 15 years as a publicly quoted enterprise, some 63% of your Company's shares are in 'free float' and our shareholder base includes a wide range of UK, European and US institutional investors.total production registered a 4.3% increase to a record 272,274 oz of gold and gold equivalent in 2017 compared with the previous year's 261,159 oz.This performance exceeded our initial 255,000 – 265,000 oz guidance range and our estimate in respect of 2018 targets looks for a maintained outcome of between the combination of a stronger Russian rouble, and the resulting slightly higher dollar production costs, as well as our utilisation of low grade ore at Belaya Gora was reflected in a 4.4% reduction in EBITDA to US$155.3 million in 2017 compared with US$162.5 million in 2016.8 Strategic Report CEO's Report Denis Alexandrov It is gratifying to report that the extensive exploration and development activity undertaken by Highland Gold during 2016 and 2017 has been rewarded with a material 56% increase in your Company's ore reserves (proven and probable) to 5.1 Moz of gold and gold equivalent as at 31 more than triple Belaya Gora's 291,000 oz recorded at the outset of 2017.Grade was reduced to 1.44 g/t versus 3.3 g/t for Belaya Gora alone.Average annual gold production is estimated at 55,000 oz, with the life of the combined mine forecast to extend Novo fully maintained its status as our lowest cost, highest margin producer by way of a 7.7% increase in the production of gold and gold equivalent to 126,000 oz in 2017 compared with 117,000 oz in 2016.A JORC reserve audit completed at Novo in November 2017 brought a 430% increase in ore The Definitive Feasibility Study for Kekura was completed in early 2018 and anticipates: • An estimated start date of 2021; • Sequential and combined open pit and underground extraction with a total mine life of 16 years (twice the original expectation); • Processing plant capacity of 800,000 tpa with an 85% recovery 10 Highland Gold Mining Ltd Units FY 2017 FY 2016 H2 2017 H1 2017 H2 2016 H1 2016 Waste stripping t 9,450,392 17,005,916 4,353,629 5,096,763 8,818,209 8,187,706 Underground development m 22,736 23,398 11,593 11,143 10, Units FY 2017 FY 2016 H2 2017 H1 2017 H2 2016 H1 2016 Waste stripping t 6,514,859 4,669,624 2,808,059 3,706,800 3,862,048 807,576 Underground development m 11,357 11,381 5,934 5, produced* oz 126,606 117,577 65,604 61,002 59,617 57,960 Units FY 2017 FY 2016 H2 2017 H1 2017 H2 2016 H1 2016 Sredny Golgotay (Kaftan) May also witnessed the receipt of licences in respect of two greenfield sites adjacent to MNV, namely Zamanchivaya (4.2 sq km located to the north east of the mine) and Kulibinskaya (38 sq km located to the south west of the mine).the recovery rate improved to 72.5% (2016: 71.4%) and the decline in overall production was limited to 6% at 43,166 oz of gold and gold equivalent.an exploratory drilling programme focused on the deep horizons of the north western flank of the Belaya Gora licence area was completed in Q4 2017, an exercise which saw 111 diamond holes, total Features include: • More than tripled gold reserves of 932,000 oz (encompassing Blagodatnoye and a 60% increase in Belaya Gora ore) versus Belaya Gora's previously reported 291,000 oz; • Upgrades to the processing plant (including the addition of a carbon in pulp production of gold and gold equivalent at Novo recorded a 7.7% increase from 2016's 117,577 oz to 126,606 oz in 2017 representing 46.5% (2016: 45%) of total output.Ore mined registered a 12.7% increase to 858,106 tonnes on a year Design documentation for the project has been split into two stages: Stage 1, which has already been filed with the Russian State Expert Board for approval, encompasses construction and installation work including the main fan unit building, the skip shaft and dosing complex, and run off water treatment facilities.Stage 2 encompasses facilities in relation to the processing plant and Engineering studies were initiated in October and technical solutions are under development.CAPITAL COSTS A total of US$2.8 million was invested at the Baley area licences in 2017.CHUKOTKA AUTONOMOUS DISTRICT, RUSSIA Kekura Work on the final sections of the Kekura Definitive Feasibility Study KYRGYZSTAN Unkurtash A scoping study was completed and published in March 2017 which envisages: • Two open pits and an 18 year LoM; • Processing plant utilisation of gravity concentration and gravity tailings CIL with an annual throughput of 4 million tonnes and recoveries of more than 80% the Lost Time Incidents Frequency Rate (LTIFR) totalled 4.88 in respect of 2017 compared with 2.30 in 2016.The number of incidents across the Group totalled 26 over the course of the year involving the aforementioned fatality and 13 incidents at Novo, five such incidents at Belaya Gora and despite price fluctuations between US$1,146 per oz and US$1,358 per oz over the course of the year, the average London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) gold price was US$1,257, an increase of 0.5% versus 2016.The prices of lead and zinc traded at their highest levels for three years the average realised price of gold in respect of MNV and Belaya Gora (net of commission) was US$1,259 per oz, which corresponded with the average market price.
