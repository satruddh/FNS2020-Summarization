engineering services business such as Babcock International, it's the people who really make a difference to how the company is perceived, both internally and externally.as individuals, we all make a difference to our colleagues, our customers and others who we interact with on a daily basis They're what we do when we're working at our best and they've been a key contributor to our successful growth over recent years.They've been gathered from the views of employees across the businesses, who were asked to consider the essence, or DNA, of Babcock at its best.the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) will establish a replacement structure to be put in place when the current contract ends and we believe that Cavendish Nuclear is well positioned to win further elements of decommissioning work, both on the Magnox estate and in the decommissioning of Sellafield With clear barriers to entry across many of our businesses, we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow the business, supported by a strong underpin of already secured future revenue.We believe the market dynamics remain positive in the sectors in which we have deep expertise, both in the UK and internationally.To achieve our target we will double the size of our global business in the next five years.As well as continuing to grow in our established markets in Australia and South Africa, we'll be building up our business in Italy, France, Canada and Spain, so that they too can become standalone countries.how can we bring focus and clarity to the discussion when the problems and solutions are inherently complex?We've made a lot of progress internationally in the last two years, but I believe that our structure was holding us back.We need to have an organisational structure that supports our ambitious growth efforts – that makes it easy for us to put together powerful, targeted in Technology, innovation will be an area of continuing focus, as we work to stay abreast of opportunities that emerge through new technological developments.
