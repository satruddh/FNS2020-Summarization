Pivoting to renewable fuels Annual report and accounts 2017 Velocys is part of a growing movement to produce increased volumes of renewable fuels, in our case primarily from forestry residues.Our process is one of the few cost effective ways to meet the economy's need for large quantities of sustainable fuels the ENVIA plant has validated our Fischer T ropsch technology at commercial scale and from this platform we plan to grow and be at the forefront of supplying significant quantities of cellulosic renewable fuels.We have a demanding plan to deliver in 201 8, but we are well placed to meet these challenges Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 1 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other highlights Contents Strategic report 1–25 Our business at a glance 2 Our focus markets 4 Chairman's statement 6 CEO's report 8 Project overview – ENVIA 10 Project overview – Mississippi biorefinery 12 Project overview – UK waste to Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 1 2 Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 2 Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Our business at a glance Velocys has a strong, multi disciplinary team operating from its US project development and commercial centre in Houston, Texas David Pummell CEO Our vision Our vision Our vision is to quickly become a producer of significant volumes of cellulosic biofuels with near term primary focus in the US market.Over the coming years the three pillars of Velocys' strategy will be: Our biorefineries The three biorefineries incorporating Velocy Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 3 4 Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Our focus markets Following the Company' s 201 6 strategy review V elocys identified the market for renewable fuels in the United States as being particularly attractive for the commercialisation of its technology There is a plentiful supply of woody biomass in the US from entirely sustainable sources that do not compete with food crops for land.The forestry industry in the Southeastern United States has been in decline from falling demand for newsprint and paper; the infrastructure servicing the industry has spare capacity in many locations.Yearly volume requirements (Renewable Volume Obligations, RVOs) are set for the obligated parties.Renewable fuel producers generate RINs, market participants trade the RINs and obligated parties either produce their own RINs or purchase RINs and then ultimately retire RINs for compliance the 2018 RVO for Cellulosic Biofuel is 288m gallons, yet the supply of D7 RINs is currently limited.A total of only 400,000 D7 RINs have ever been generated within the US.ENVIA is expected to generate around 100,000 D7 RINs per month and Velocy Velocys is focused on its commercialisation through the delivery, with its partners, of repeatable biorefineries to become a producer of significant volumes of cellulosic renewable fuels.We will remember 2017 as the year Velocys transitioned from technology development to its commercial roll out.The appointment of Andrew Morris has helped to align Board competencies to those needed to guide the delivery of the Company's strategy.Board costs have been reduced through the reduction in the number of Non Executive Directors, and by reducing the fees paid to existing Non Executive Directors by 10%.Susan Robertson stepped down as Chief Financial Officer in august 2017, the proceeds raised were used primarily to fund the pre FEED (FEL 2) engineering study for the Mississippi biorefinery project, to undertake a joint technology demonstration with our partner TRI, and to extend Velocys' loan arrangement with ENVIA to support the plant in achieving steady state operations Significant impairment made against a range of, primarily, intangible assets.David Pummell Chief Executive Officer Introduction 2017 was a challenging year for Velocys, but despite this, the Company has made significant progress towards developing what we expect will be the first of a number of repeatable bio ENVIA In 2Q 2018 we announced the disappointing news that a leak has been detected at the Oklahoma City plant that is believed to have originated inside one of the plant's two FT reactors.Based on a preliminary investigation the Company believes the root cause of the issue originated with the design of an ancillary system and is not a result of Velocys remains committed to the ENVIA plant and will work with ENVIA to assess the likely repair cost and consequent funding requirements.Successive milestones were met at ENVIA over the course of 2017, as outlined on page 10.Most recently (post period end), we were pleased to report that the RINs produced at EN Mississippi biorefinery Throughout 2017 we made encouraging progress towards the development of our first biorefinery in the US using woody biomass as feedstock (see pages 12 and 13 for more details).We welcome the significant support for the plant at county and state levels.the local community has responded positively to the prospect of the quality jobs that the construction and operation of the Velocys believes that there is an opportunity to develop a series of waste to jet fuel plants in the UK and recognises that there is a larger non UK market to be exploited.the changes to the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation (RTFO), recently passed through Parliament, have provided the commercial platform for this opportunity; for the first time 10 Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Project overview – ENVIA ENVIA Energy, LLC (ENVIA) is a joint venture, of which Velocys is an equity partner, formed to produce renewable diesel, naphtha and wax from landfill gas and natural gas This was an important milestone for ENVIA as a significant proportion of the revenues of the plant could be derived from the ongoing sale of RINs.Financial modelling shows that RIN revenues are required for the plant to be cash flow positive.The RINs produced at ENVIA are the first RINs generated by Velocy Velocys was called upon to leverage its experienced team of technical advisors to support the ENVIA team on site, which allowed work to proceed close to the original plan, as well as supporting the delivery of the subsequent operational milestones.As part of the commissioning process, throughout 2017 the ENVIA team, supported by 12 Velocys plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Velocys' first biorefinery using forestry residues as feedstock is being developed in Mississippi, USA.The Company has made considerable progress in 201 7 towards the aim of achieving final investment decision and construction.This is the first of an expected series of biorefineries with standard ThermoChem Recovery International (TRI) is the Company's partner for the gasification of woody biomass.TRI is an innovative leader in its field and has committed significant resources to a joint work programme.The Company is also engaging with other technology licensors in key areas of the process design, integrating with Land that meets all the required criteria including space and terrain to support an industrial development.
