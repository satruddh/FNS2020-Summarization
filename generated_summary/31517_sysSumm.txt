operations are organised to run more efficiently and effectively in the light of this change of pricing strategy and market positioning.In meeting the challenges ahead, we will continue to build on the strong strategic initiatives we developed in 2017, in particular, our digital marketing and brand strategies In order to maintain a balanced Board he will not be replaced as Andrew Davies' replacement will not be a Main Board Director.Alan has provided wise counsel to the Board during his time as a director.Whilst Alan is stepping down as a director, given the challenges facing our funeral business and his industry knowledge, It also differentiates us from many competitors in what is still, regrettably, an unregulated industry.As such it provides assurance and confidence to our clients and fosters long term investment, financial stability and business integrity.As a Board we are therefore committed to maintaining our high standards of corporate governance and ensuring there is a high Delivering excellent client service remains a key strategic priority and means that we can offer the best quality service at each price point and market segment in which we choose to operate.We are now positioning ourselves as the best value service provider in the market, leveraging the strong investment in the funeral business that we have made over the years Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 | 07 New pricing strategy This increasingly competitive market was the background against which the decision to change our pricing strategy and market positioning was made in early 2018.In 2017, approximately 60 per cent of our funerals were traditional full service funerals, seven per cent were simple funerals and approximately 27 per The first example of this was Simplicity Cremations, launched in November 2016 and currently averaging a run rate of 1,000 direct cremations per year.We also continue to view selective acquisitions of well established funeral businesses as an appropriate use of capital despite the changing market.We will also continue to develop our network of crematoria Adjusting pricing is relatively straightforward, but the greater challenge is building the infrastructure and developing the staff necessary to provide excellent service.We believe this is where the years of investment in our facilities and staff training will pay dividends, for us as a company, but also for our clients.It means we can offer them unrivalled service at each product and service some of the Group's key performance indicators rely on the total number of estimated deaths for each period and this information is obtained from the Office for National Statistics ('ONS').Although annual deaths have declined significantly since the early 1990s from 640,000 to a low of 539,000 in 2011, the last five years have seen deaths above that level 800,000 700,000 600,000 500,000 400,000 300,000 200,000 100,000 0 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010

political interest in the Sun Life's 2017 Cost of Dying report also describes how, within their surveyed population, nine per cent (compared to seven per cent the year before) of funerals last year were eco, environmental or woodland funerals.They also report 31 per cent of funerals being described by funeral directors as a "celebration of life funeral" In the digital age there is a compelling requirement, and opportunity, to leverage and build a national brand and add that to the mix, supporting and enhancing our strong local market positions.The first step has been to create a new brand style and to begin to develop brand awareness online.This work is a strategic priority for the The Group has also launched a new service for clients that makes it easier for them to notify family members through email, social media and the internet of funeral arrangements.This service also allows families to order flowers and make donations online.We are piloting a number of other client supporting initiatives and services.If successful this will be followed by national roll outs we regret very much that the provision of funeral services is not regulated and have continued to lead calls for this to change.Dignity would welcome regulation of the funeral industry which set out minimum standards for core activities such as the care of the deceased, minimum standards of facilities and also operating procedures in crematoria.The aim is to produce guidance for consumers and the industry on the decisions to be made at the point of determining a cremation, and their potential impact.The second project looks at what consumers most value from a cremation service.With this insight we will be able to ensure that our cremation services are giving clients what they really want and value What are the Group's immediate strategic priorities?It is very clear.We as a management team and Board have to deliver the new strategy.This means promoting our new offerings and positioning to the marketplace and providing an unrivalled and competitively priced service, to the marketplace.
