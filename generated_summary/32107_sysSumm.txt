Sigma quality on such a high volume of components and devices.A  Ability to operate at scales from grams to full commercial scale.B  Low volume hand machined production through to high volume assembly.LEVERAGE CORE STRENGTHS/BUSINESS WITH EXISTING AND NEW CUSTOMERS  Award of two new development contracts  Significant new development and supply agreement for proprietary pMDI valve and actuator technology for Aeropharm DEEPEN OFFERING CAPTURING MORE OF THE VAL • In injectables, we signed a significant new master development agreement for our proprietary Vapoursoft ® Syrina ® auto

Bespak's device development and manufacturing, as well as Aesica's formulation, manufacturing and filling CSRT OUR BUSINESS Strategic Report OUR STRATEGY BY MARKET The global market for inhaled drug delivery devices is forecast to reach US$43 billion in 2024, growing at an estimated CAGR of 3.3% between 2016 and 2024.The respiratory sector is one of the most highly regulated, resulting in high barriers Whilst Bespak currently has a negligible share of this market, it is estimated that c.40% of all new drugs in development will be delivered parenterally and may, therefore, require some form of auto injector.Many of these new "large molecule" biologic drugs are highly viscous and require specialist devices to enable These innovative drug delivery devices demonstrate Bespak's capabilities from device feasibility, concept and initial design through device development and also demonstrate the ability of the Innovation team to deliver product diversification opportunities in the drug delivery sector.
