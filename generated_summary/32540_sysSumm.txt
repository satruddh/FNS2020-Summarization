Energy Outlook 2017 Edition, January 2017 Power Generation – Centralised – Fossil Fuels Gas is expected to be the fastest growing fuel (1.6% p.a.Power Generation – Centralised – Fossil Fuels (Gas) Key market drivers include the price of natural gas, the speed and ease of construction of gas fired power plants, reduced carbon emissions relative to coal and oil and the need to "fill the gap" as the zero carbon energy sources (nuclear and 10 Power Generation – Centralised – Renewables (Solar / Wind) Growth in solar is driven primarily by photovoltaic (PV) technology and wind is being driven by large wind turbines, both onshore and offshore.HTG does not currently have a competitive product offering in either of these technologies Although the market is at the early development stage, Hayward Tyler's submersible motor expertise is ideal to develop reliable submersible generator technologies for wave and tidal schemes.Hayward Tyler is currently working in partnership with several universities and private developers to position itself as an industry leader in this growing technology space.Hayward Tyler continues to enjoy a stable position in the nuclear supply chain servicing its existing installed base as well as taking orders for new units, both of which result from the key accreditations of our US and UK businesses.With 75% of the 438 operational reactors worldwide currently over 25 years old, growth opportunities for aftermarket parts NuScale are in the process of applying for a Design Certificate from the US NRC and are one of the companies in discussion with the UK Government for the £250 million of funding to support SMR localisation and deployment in the UK.Power Generation – Distributed Distributed generation is typified by systems which are small

mainly in the Middle East, however, there are significant upgrade opportunities based on the global installed base as many refineries respond to new operational requirements or changing regulations.Water and Industrial – Municipal Water, General Industrial and Chemical The water and industrial sector, in all its forms, is the largest The seal less design eliminates the need for a dynamic seal and utilises the process fluid as a coolant with no need for an external fan.Industrial chemical plants see this technology as a safer and more reliable alternative to traditional products and the trend is to use canned motor retrofits to replace these products Chairman's Statement A DEMANDING YEAR "The second half provides the platform for growth" A mixed performance against challenging market conditions "The Group had a mixed trading year based on a weak first half being offset by a strong second half performance and record order book entering the new financial year"

progressive dividend policy.Hayward Tyler Group PLC Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 17 Corporate Governance Please Achievements  Ended the year with a record order book and a clear strategy of how to drive further growth in order intake going into the new fiscal year.Continued to rebuild accreditations and customer relationships at Peter Brotherhood with our first major order won and first significant order shipped;  Created a new Group Commercial role A huge amount of time, effort and investment has gone into the 'front end' of the business focused on marketing, sales and the 'win order' process.Key to this action was the appointment of Dr Colin Elcoate to the newly created position of Chief Commercial Officer with responsibility for global commercial activity across the Group one of Peter Brotherhood's advantages is that it remains an 'independent' supplier and as such can be more flexible in terms of product offering and response times than its larger, global rivals.The Group has continued to invest in numerous exhibitions globally to broaden the reach, particularly of Peter Brotherhood, to try to expand part of the investment made in the 'win order' process highlighted above has been to pull together a universal and consistent approach to the pipeline of opportunities across the Group (both in terms of customer, market segment and geography).
