Strategic report 05 Annual report and financial statements 2017 | Safestore Holdings plc Outlook In the last 18 months Safestore has further strengthened its market positions in both the UK and Paris with the acquisitions of Space Maker and Alligator, the opening of six new stores and the establishment of a pipeline Of our 146 stores (including Alligator), 93 are in London and the South East of England or in Paris, with 53 in the other major UK cities.We now operate 44 stores within the M25, which represents a higher number of stores than any other competitor.The Group has continued to invest in its consumer website as well as in house expertise which has resulted in the development of a leading digital marketing platform that has generated over 40% enquiry growth over the last four years.In December 2016, the Group launched a new trading website for the Paris business, building on the success of the November 2016 saw the launch of our internal Store Manager Development Programme, designed to provide the business with its future store managers.The first group of trainees graduated in November 2017 and the second intake of sales consultants have now commenced the 2018 programme.As with our new Alligator colleagues, new recruits to the business benefit from enhanced induction In addition, a Values and Behaviours framework is overlaid on individuals' financial performance in order to assess team members' performance and development needs on a quarterly basis.Customers continue to be at the heart of everything we do, whether it be in store, online or in their communities.Strong and flexible capital structure Since 2014 we have refinanced the business on three occasions and believe we now have a capital structure that is appropriate for our business and which provides us with the flexibility to take advantage of carefully evaluated development and acquisition opportunities.On 31 May 2017 we completed the refinancing of the Group's US private placement notes ("USPP") as part of the refinancing, the Group made a "make whole" payment to existing USPP noteholders of £12.4 million and broke the Sterling/Dollar cross currency swap relating to the existing USPP notes.leading to the Group receiving £13.9 million, being the mark to market value of the swap which was in the Group's favour the Group's LTV ratio under the new financing arrangements was 36% as at 31 October 2017; however, this has been distorted due to the drawdown of £56 million of loans just prior to the year end in anticipation of the Alligator acquisition, which completed immediately after the year end on 1 November 2017 We now have planning permission and have started construction on a new circa 54,000 sq ft store on this site.The store is scheduled to open in the first half of the current financial year. "In the last 16 months, the Group has opened six new stores" 19+ 47+34+Q Owned The store has 73,500 sq ft of MLA and circa 10,000 sq ft of serviced offices.We believe there will be further opportunities to develop new stores in the outer suburbs of Paris and are actively reviewing the market for new opportunities.In November 2017, we exchanged contracts on a site at Poissy, in the west of Space Maker has been fully integrated into the Safestore portfolio from an operational perspective during the course of the 2017 financial year, and is performing in line with its business plan.
