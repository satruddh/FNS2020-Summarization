The Strategic Report consists of the Overview, Strategy and Performance sections on pages 1 to 43 of this Annual Report.An introduction to the report covering who we are, the Chairman's reflections on the year, a description of our business and an overview of the marketplace in which we operate.On 20 March 201 7 we announced an agreement to merge Vodafone India with Idea Cellular in India, as a result Vodafone India is now excluded from Group figures unless otherwise stated.India still remains part of the Group from an operational perspective.All amounts marked with an "*" represent organic growth which presents performance on a comparable basis In order to enable an adequate return on the massive investments that will be required to provide Europe with the infrastructure required for a competitive economy in the age of digitalisation, a predictable regulatory framework is required that supports both investment and competition.In this regard we are encouraged by the European Commission's ('EC') revised European Framework Review for Telecoms For example, our report on "T axation and our total economic contribution to public finances" highlights our total contribution to governments of €15.6 billion in the 2016 financial year.Our charitable activities are also expanding in scope, as the Vodafone Foundation leverages our technology and expertise with funding from external NGOs and other partners to expand its impact I would also like to thank our employees and business partners for their efforts and contribution to Vodafone's progress, as well as our shareholders for their support and confidence.Gerard Kleisterlee Chairman Creating value for society, delivering results for shareholders Vodafone's purpose is to connect everybody to live a better today and build a better tomorrow Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 04 We deliver a differentiated customer experience through CARE Connectivity that is reliable and secure Always excellent value Rewarding loyalty Easy access to customer support Raising the bar in customer service with 2,100 new roles across the UK We will create 2, 100 new customer service roles in the These converged offers, which combine mobile, fixed and content services, provide simplicity and better value for customers.They also increase customer loyalty and deliver operational efficiencies.We offer a range of converged offers such as "GigaKombi" in Germany and "Vodafone One" in Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 08 Split of service revenue 76% Mobile service revenue 24% Fixed service revenue 1 7.9m Fixed customers 1 2016: 13.4 m 13.8m TV customers 1 2016: 9.5m 516m Mobile customers 1 2016: 493m 3.8m Converged customers 2016: 9 Within Vodafone India's 17 4G circles.Europe Albania, Czech Republic 1, Germany 1, Greece 1, Hungary, Ireland 1, Italy 1, Malta 1, Netherlands 1 (joint venture), Portugal 1, Romania 1, Spain 1, UK 1 AMAP Australia On average, a customer consumes 203 outgoing minutes per month, which has been largely stable over the last couple of years.The demand for mobile data services to watch videos, browse the internet and use various "apps" has accelerated rapidly, and today 48% of global revenue comes from data, compared to this network technology innovation has been accompanied by the growing demand for smartphones, which are now used by 63% of Vodafone's European customers.Fixed network development has been equally rapid.In the 1990s most fixed connections were for landline calls, today the greatest use is broadband internet usage.Average download speeds have progressed rapidly from around 8–1 6 Mbps Vodafone's European businesses are overseen by more than 200 national and regional regulatory authorities covering areas such as spectrum allocation, roaming charges, consumer rights, copyright, data protection, cyber security and the wholesale fees that operators charge each other.While these policies are designed to protect consumers, for example by championing ever lower retail prices, they have historically failed 40% Average reduction in the price per GB of data over the last three years 2 Why we are well positioned We have launched roaming inclusive plans across all our EU markets well in advance of regulation and already have a significant portion of our customers that do not pay extra for EU roaming.Vodafone typically offers twice the number of 4G roam Overall, I am pleased to report that the Group's commercial and financial performance has further improved, although on a reported basis this was masked by currency headwinds.Network Leadership: building a "Gigabit Vodafone" After the large investments made during Project Spring, this year our capital spending, measured as a percentage in the UK, this is not yet the case; we have recovered a leadership position in terms of network performance and have significantly reduced customer complaints, but we still lag the competition in our overall customer perception.We are confident that our recovery 'CARE' plan will improve the situation in the UK as well.As a result, consumer contract ARPU stabilised after many years of decline.This good performance was reflected in European service revenue growth of 0.6%* vs. 0.6%* last year.All major markets grew during the year, except the UK.This was an absolute increase in traffic this year of 995 petabytes, which was greater than the total traffic carried on the network last year.Growth was driven by continued adoption of 4G, with 28 million customers added during the year bringing the total base to 75 million at the end of March.63% of our customers have a smartphone in Europe, compared to 59% last year – Data usage is increasingly driven by the demand for high definition video, which requires fast download speeds for a great user experience.Data traffic increased 65% during the year – Users want to use data without worrying about unexpected costs whether using their mobiles at home or churn rates for customers buying multiple products are substantially lower – so our success in winning fixed relationships is also expected to make our mobile base both more secure and more profitable over time.Our fixed network footprint continues to expand, and we are now able to reach over 96 million NGN homes in Europe, giving us the largest market bundle fixed and mobile services together under a single contract – to easily share content between their mobile phone, tablet, laptop or TV – Access to TV programmes bundled with fixed broadband is an increasingly important driver of demand for converged services.The growing demand for converged services drives data usage.Chief Executive's strategic review (continued) Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 14 Enterprise Leading in total communications Context – Seamlessly integrated connectivity has become a central part of running a business today – Businesses are seeking secure and reliable mobile and fixed solutions to support efficient and effective operations.Vodafone Global Enterprise grew 3.0%* in the year.
