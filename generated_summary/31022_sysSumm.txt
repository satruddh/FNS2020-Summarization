understanding our operating environment and focusing on our strategic priorities, we are able to deliver against our objectives Ageing populations, alongside population growth the past year has been a mix of challenge and opportunity.Revenue growth was impacted by the delay in the approval of VR315 (US), the Group's US generic Advair ® programme partnered with Hikma.Whilst this has had a significant impact on the share price, we should not let this overshadow the operational progress achieved this application of Vectura's FOX ® smart nebuliser technology, from the Activaero acquisition, has enabled an almost one hour reduction in the total daily treatment time for patients who are receiving treatment (iloprost) up to six times a day, a very meaningful improvement in November 2017 the Board also approved a share buyback and cancellation programme to return up to £15m of capital to shareholders.This programme, which completed post period, is an efficient allocation of capital as part of our ongoing strong financial management discipline and demonstrates the Board's confidence in the cash generation of the business.Her extensive understanding of the healthcare industry and experience in corporate finance bring important insight to Board discussions, as well as supplementing and strengthening the existing skills and experience of the Board.Juliet's appointment also signals the Board's and Vectura's commitment to increased diversity up and down the organisation.2 Certain measures in this Annual Report, including underlying financial information, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted operating profit, are not prepared in accordance with IFRS.Underlying financial measures are reconciled back to their most directly comparable IFRS measures in the Financial review.Vectura Group plc STRATEGIC REPORT Future self commercialisation of our specialist assets remains an option open to us but only as part of a wider commercial portfolio.Vectura has a well established business with proven capabilities and a simple differentiated business model which can be described in three simple steps: firstly, inhaled drug formulation Typically, our formulation licensing expertise is seen in the revenues from novel patented molecules for inhaled delivery including Novartis' Ultibro ® Breezhaler ® and GSK's Ellipta ® portfolio.Proprietary device licensing is a relatively small part of the business, again typically for Vectura will be more selective in identifying partnering and co development opportunities for novel molecules, focusing only on highly profitable and significant opportunities.Existing early stage novel programmes will be out licensed where the cost, risk and likely returns do not meet our newly defined investment criteria.Our strategy remains one where we are pursuing growth whilst, at the Ultibro ® Breezhaler ® continues to be the leading LAMA/LABA combination ex US and is maintaining a strong growth profile despite heavy competition from Boehringer's Stiolto ® combination.Following the initial rapid launch of Stiolto, its market share is now stabilising our unique capabilities have been validated throughout the regulatory review process and the lessons we have learned on the VR315 (US) programme journey put us in a good position going for future development of complex generic programmes.Following the announcement of the partnering of VR2081, and the in licensing of an advanced tiotropium from Pulmat Based on the increased conviction in both the differentiation and validation of our devices seen with BreelibTM, we are now initiating the development of a series of known compounds where, through formulation and enhanced delivery, we believe that efficacy and convenience of delivery for the patient can be significantly improved.The team demonstrated great tenacity and resilience and I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks for their contributions and support.With strong in market product performance and validation of our team's skills, capabilities and technology during 2017, we enter 2018 with a clear, refocused investment strategy and increased conviction in our ability to create the asthma market as a whole is expected to grow from $17bn to nearly $18bn 3, with growth being driven by the emergence of closed triple therapies such as QVM149 (ICS/LAMA/LABA, partnered with Novartis) and biologic therapies expected to grow strongly from a small base offsetting generic Advances in science and technology innovation are critical if we are to address unmet medical need.Existing drugs will continue to be important in meeting the growing demand for healthcare, particularly with the increasing use of generic medication.
