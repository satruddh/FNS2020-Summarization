Shareholder the Board remains committed to a policy of enhanced dividend distribution and is planning to modify its dividend policy towards higher rates of distribution, having in mind the requirements of the business and the need to maintain its financial strength.Within these constraints, the Board would consider distributing up to 75% of its free cash flow as dividends this has enabled the Group to undertake an increased capital expenditure programme during 2017 and, in spite of some overruns in the costs of the Uzen horizontal well, to end the year with healthy cash balances and remain in a positive net cash position after taking into account borrowings.this is in addition to paying US$5.0 million in dividends to shareholders in 2017 ( although the change was achieved at low capital cost, in the first months after implementation, the plant throughput was kept at low levels while the process management was optimised.Throughput at the gas plant was gradually increased and in December 2017 was averaged 533,000 m 3 per day (18.8 mmcf/d).ANDREY ZOZULYA CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER volumes on the financial performance of the Group was less than it may have been

interventions on the VM field, workovers and reperforations of the well bores.On Dobrinskoye, which is a more mature gas field, there are also plans to drill a sidetrack on well #26 The Dobrinskoye gas processing plant was originally designed and constructed to utilise a Sulfanox based gas sweetening process, which had the benefit of low capital cost but carried high chemical usage and generated substantial volumes of waste requiring careful disposal.the plant was designed with a maximum throughput capacity of one million the LPG project will provide an additional product stream which is expected to increase total sales volumes by approximately 400 boepd and to enhance profitability.Although construction was largely accomplished before the end of 2017 as planned, due to delays in delivery of certain items of equipment and to regulatory clearance, completion of the project was delayed by approximately three months Following the installation of a flow line from the well site to the main Uzen field facilities in December 2017, well #101 has been put on continuous production.Between January and March 2018, well #101 has been producing at an average rate of approximately 300
