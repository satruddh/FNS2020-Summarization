converted to strong free cash flow, I firmly believe that under Dean's leadership we have established a sustainable model of growth.Equally, I am repeatedly struck by the passion, commitment and expertise of our staff across the Group in delivering the quality of services our customers rightly Our disciplined acquisition strategy also continues to prove successful, as both high quality new businesses generating returns of at least 15% are brought into the Group, but also opening additional new growth avenues.As Dean again sets out in his report, the emerging urban growth model in Geneva and in major cities in North America has been driven by our recent acquisitions Our Values Underpinning this Vision we have a common set of values across the business Excellence We constantly strive to be excellent in all that we do Safety We only do what is safe and stop any unsafe behaviour Customers We place them at the heart of our business and relentlessly meet their expectations People We develop the talents, reward the exceptional performance and respect the rights Opportunity North America continues to grow, while the Spanish economy has strengthened over the last couple of years, with levels of tourism also very strong – demand for public transport is likely to improve further as the economy grows and employment levels continue to rise.Our response We continue to look for opportunities to grow our businesses in North America and ALSA, both by organic means Opportunity The growth in the urban populations* of the US, UK and Spain are forecast to increase by 10%, 8% and 2% respectively over the next decade, driving the need for further public transport services.while the combination of an ageing and increasingly social and ethnically diverse population will drive the need for new products and services to meet changing customer needs Our response We work hard with our Alliance partners, Transport for West Midlands and the Metro Mayor, to deliver more environmentally friendly transport, easing congestion with faster journey times from priority bus lanes and lowering emissions with Euro six compliant buses.We are also investing in hybrid and electric buses in the UK, Spain and US Economic environment Deregulation, liberalisation and outsourcing Urbanisation and demographic changes Modal shift Environment and congestion Technology The propensity to travel is generally affected by levels of economic activity, as represented by GDP growth.Although levels of transportation and mobility remain relatively stable through the economic cycle, periods of GDP growth generate additional volume demand and pricing benefit In 2014, 54% of the world's population lived in urban centres and this is projected to grow to 66% by 2050, while 73% of the population in Europe and 82% of the population in North America already live in urban centres.These trends are driving the requirement for additional transportation services, both within and between locations.Society as a whole and individuals are becoming increasingly concerned about the effect of emissions on the environment and are explicitly choosing public transport as an alternative.Opportunity Improved access to city centre locations, such as priority bus lanes for environmentally friendly transport and lower congestion.Move to electric and hybrid buses to lower emissions.Our response We work hard with our Alliance partners, Transport for west Link to strategic priorities Growing our business through acquisitions and market diversification, p11 Growing our
