however it is offered in a more accessible and contemporary environment.The first Luda venue was opened on 7 August 2017 in Walsall and two further venues are due to open in Leeds and Weston super Mare later in the year.As highlighted in our recent interim results, the Group faced increased costs during the year following the introduction of the National Living Wage and increased property rent costs.The combination of these cost increases and challenging UK retail conditions resulted in the Group undertaking a detailed review of its UK organisational structure and cost base.On 30 June 2017, the Group's human resources director, Sue Waldock, retired after 28 years with the Group.Following Sue's retirement, David Balls was appointed to succeed her.David was previously Grosvenor's human resources director, and will continue to hold this position alongside his Group role.We understand the important role the right culture plays in the gaming industry and in addressing our responsibilities to our customers and wider society.Work continues to bring STARS to life for all of Rank's employees.I would like to take the opportunity, on behalf of the board, to thank Rank's employees for their continued passion Our customers We create value for our customers by providing them with market leading entertainment, meeting their expectations through our multi channel offer.Our shareholders Through focused investments to meet our customers' needs, we generate suitable returns for our shareholders.Our employees We provide our talented and dedicated individuals with rewarding and fulfilling careers, ensuring that Grosvenor Casinos' new digital sports offer Cheltenham Festival and Ascot preview events were held in the year;
