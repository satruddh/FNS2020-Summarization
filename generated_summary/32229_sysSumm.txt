the charge associated with Balance Sheet and Cash At the year end the cash balances of the Group were £58.5m (2016: £48.9m).The increase was mainly a product of the reduction, over the year, in the Group's portfolio of seed investments.At the balance sheet date the Group held £22.1m of investments although the impact of the restatement, on a net basis, is immaterial to the face of the balance sheet (see Note 2.8), the change from reporting the holding under the single line item of assets held for sale to line by line consolidation has necessitated some restatement of prior year numbers whereby the gross assets On the basis of such review and the significant liquid assets underpinning the balance sheet relative to the Group's predictable operating cost profile, the Directors consider that the adoption of a going concern basis, covering a period of at least 12 months from the date of this report, is appropriate.The Group has a formal Risk Committee that convenes monthly and is chaired by the Group's Chief Risk Officer ('CRO') and comprises the Chief Executive, the Chief Operating Officer, the Global Head of Distribution and Mr Ashford Russell.The Committee reviews all the portfolios managed by the Group and has presented to The Board through the work of the Audit Committee receives and reviews regular reports on the compliance controls in place to prevent or detect any non compliance of the Group with rules and regulations.The Audit Committee Report on pages 24 to 26 provides further details on the work undertaken.Operational risk Operational risk arises from potentially inadequate or failed processes, from people and also from The Board reviews the business strategy periodically and considers financial, fund performance and operational information regularly.The Group's reputation is one of its most important assets since it operates in an industry where integrity, customer trust and confidence are paramount.The Group's in house compliance and
