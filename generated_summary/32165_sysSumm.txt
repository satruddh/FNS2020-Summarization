1.9%.This is covered 1.6 times.Grow earnings before interest, tax and depreciation (adjusted eBiTDA) and adjusted profit before tax (adjusted PBT).progress 2016/17 Future priorities To generate growth by building strong positions in branded and added value markets • Combined volumes of four key brands are flat: Cathedral City master brand launch with support from TV advertising – growth in second half Clover and other spreads brands grow volumes well ahead of the market and take a combined 2 percentage points Adjusted profit before tax has increased by 5% to £60.6 million and profit margins have increased to 16.4%.This performance has been delivered despite a highly volatile background in global dairy markets.In the first half of the year, milk volumes were strong across the UK and falling milk and cream prices reflected this.we are producing demineralised whey, an added value by product of the cheese making process.Demineralised whey is the base ingredient for infant formula and by March 2017 over 80% of production was meeting the exacting standards required for use in infant formula recipes.Furthermore, we have also started manufacturing GOS at Davidstow Summary Our performance this year is not only a result of the Group's long term strategy but also a reflection of the significant contribution and dedication of all of our employees, for which I would like to thank them.The Board remains confident in the future prospects for Dairy Crest.Low milk prices had an effect on milk volumes.They were down in most large milk producing countries across the world.Consequently milk prices rose.During the course of the year we have increased the price we pay farmers for milk by 38% to 30 pence per litre.Since then we have announced a 1 pence per litre reduction from In order to maintain the brand's premium positioning within the category we decided against discounting aggressively.Consequently, Cathedral City slightly underperformed this market growth, with volumes down 3% for the year.however volumes improved in the second half and this positive momentum has continued into 2017/18.an important part of the long term future for GOS is its potential beyond the infant formula market, to extend its use into other areas such as animal and adult nutrition.The research and development programme for GOS in animals has broadened and during the year we signed an agreement with Danisco Animal Nutrition, part of DuPont.Trials are now underway in this partnership our main spreads brand, Clover, had a very successful year, growing volumes at 1% versus a significant market decline, partly driven by increased promotional volumes.Our other smaller spreads brands, Utterly Butterly, Vitalite and Willow also performed well and our total volume growth as well as building on the success of the new Clover product, in the year ended 31 March 2017, we: • brought a new Frylight product to market – avocado spray oil; • developed a new Frylight cap design to be launched in early 2017/18; • launched a new Cathedral City snack bar range We have continued to make good progress in our demineralised whey operations at Davidstow.We are now hitting our targeted level of demineralised whey being of infant formula grade.Developing our sales of demineralised whey and GOS into the high margin global infant formula market will 2017 £m 2016 £m Change £m
