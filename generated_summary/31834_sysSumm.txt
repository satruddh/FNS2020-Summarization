Crop enhancement – advancing the science of crop potential PLANT IMPACT PLC Annual Report 2017 PLANT IMPACT PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2017 PLANT IMPACT PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Our starting point is plant science What we do We understand physiological stress responses and resource prioritisation in key world crops.STRATEGIC REPORT Highlights 01 Chairman's Statement 02 Chief Executive's Review 04 Our

and grower adoption of new, high tech inputs) has depressed commodity prices in the world's big crops: corn, soybeans, wheat and rice.This has created significant pressure on growers' profitability and the financial performance of the distributors and input manufacturers who supply Having worked successfully with the previous strategic plan from 2011 to 2016 of globalising and placing our products into important sectors of world agriculture, this evolution of our strategy will emphasise and build upon our productive R&D discovery capability.We believe that a wealth of novelty in discovery coupled with proven development and commercial placement capability is the best choice we can make For the first time, our R&D progress is enabling us to trial an integrated, full season portfolio of four individually developed yield products and prototypes for soybeans.Ultimately, and in combination, we are developing them to deliver a consistent double digit yield improvement for growers; this is without precedent in this category Over the last 12 months, we have evolved this strategy for the next stage of our development.Our update recognises that R&D activities are at the core of what we are seeking to achieve and that these provide the main engine for an appreciation in long term shareholder value.This 2017 strategic plan (i) organises our Chief Executive's Review continued PRIORITIES DESCRIPTION 2016/17 PROGRESS LOOKING FORWARD 0.1 Focus R&D on plant physiological responses and plant resource prioritisation Our work begins with an understanding of plant physiology to ensure maximum product efficacy Our R&D team has made good progress with characterising key yield limiting plant Our agreement with Ghent University gives us access to novel compounds as part of our focus on drought tolerance In FY18+ we plan to invest in higher throughput discovery and screening capabilities 0.4 Create effective products from a replicable R&D platform approach Our platform is founded on repeatable processes we have developed for predicting chemical entities that will perform, then rapidly character the insight and capabilities we are gaining as we develop full programmes of technologies for these two crops will help us to extend these for other major crops in the future eg.cotton and oil seed rape (dicots) and rice, and corn (monocots) For the first time, in 2016 our soybean R&D trials in Brazil the resulting cash generation has helped to fund the bulk of our R&D to date Excellent regional distribution partnership agreements signed for Fortalis ® in the USA Commitment from BCS, Arysta LifeScience and key North American distribution partners to our products remains strong Our products and pipeline are being evaluated by several other agrochemical multinationals Over the past year, we have identified partners who are eager to launch these early stage formulations under their own labels.These commercial opportunities are being actively considered as interim solutions which can generate supplemental corporate funding for additional R&D in our core discovery and product development activities.this investment included additional temporary field agent resources to run demonstration programmes for dealers and growers and investment in a digital marketing campaign targeted specifically at growers.These investments did not achieve the results we had hoped for and growth in grower use of the product fell well short of the plans that we had agreed with BCS.Campaign plans have been agreed, and we will again be supporting them in the field.By incorporating the learning of the last campaigns, our support will be more effectively structured to drive grower adoption this season.Looking forward, both the Group and BCS aim to move to higher volume strategies and recognise that the current commercial arrangements may need to feedback from growers using and testing the product has been very good, and the yield improvements were consistent with our targets in the 4 5% range.Following this programme, we have designed a promotional campaign which has some elements of our channel strategy in both Brazil and United States.In Argentina, we plan to work directly with regional distributors, but maintain some collaboration Arysta Chief Executive's Review continued 5% APPROX 5% VERITAS ® YIELD UPLIFT 11

headcount and on costs associated with the the share based payment charge primarily relates to options granted under the Value Creation Plan (VCP) that was adopted by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in November 2014 and for which the first options were granted on 31 July 2015.The charge is predominantly a non cash expense other than provision for employer's National Insurance costs on expected exercises where the lower share price Previously capitalised costs are being amortised from first commercial sale over periods of from 5 to 20 years depending on the expected longevity of the related technology or product.£4.2m R&D SPEND Chief Executive's Review continued 15 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORT STRATEGI The Group has a £1.0m invoice financing facility with HSBC Bank plc under which it can draw down up to 80% of all outstanding invoices, subject to a concentration limit.As at 31 July 2017 there were no drawings (31 July 2016: £50k of cash drawn down with recourse).Together they act as scientific advisers to our R&D team as part of a collaborative network of experts with diverse industry and specialism backgrounds and a shared goal to help advance innovation in crop enhancement.
