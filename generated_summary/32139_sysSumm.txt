sales are in the area of 3D Plant and Marine design.We aim to grow sales of other design tools such as AVEVA Electrical, AVEVA Engineering and information management we enjoyed success in North America, where our local strategy of leading with sales to OOs and of MT3D products is working well and resulted in key new customer wins, including Southern Company and one of the world's leading industrial conglomerates.Although we continue to see growth potential in China, our business there performed less well during the Our strategy is to increase revenues by expanding the addressable market as the concept of the Digital Asset is more widely adopted, to sell a wider range of products, and to grow in industry and geographic verticals where the Group' s market share is underweight, versus the strength of its product offering 16 % Revenues from Owner Operators in 2017 3 GROWTH MARKETS AVEVA generates almost 50% of its revenue from EMEA.This largely reflects our heritage as a UK based company and indicates an opportunity to take a larger share of the global market.– We intend to grow our revenues in key markets such 77 % AVEVA's recurring revenues in 2017 10 AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 CHAIRMAN'S ST A TEMENT AVEVA DELIVERED A RESILIENT PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR.WE WILL CONTINUE TO TARGET GROWTH, we also made good progress with our strategy of increasing our sales to Owner Operators (OOs), growth in the key North American market and in broadening our market exposure outside of Oil & Gas and Marine.For example, during the year we had considerable success in the Power market, winning contracts with companies including KEPCO E& Summary AVEVA is now in its 50th year, having been founded in 1967 as a government funded research institute created by the then UK Ministry of Technology at Cambridge University.The Company's original mission, to develop computer aided design techniques for use by British industry, has been achieved and indeed greatly exceeded.This decline had a significant impact on the workloads of our EPC customers, with the more complex (and therefore design intensive) upstream and offshore projects being impacted the most by lower oil prices.This, in turn, led to some consolidation in our customer base.These developments impacted demand for our software.Longer term trends in Power are positive as the world's emerging economies invest in their power generation requirements and the ageing infrastructure of the developed world is maintained or replaced.In the shorter term, AVEVA has benefited from market share gains and more demanding technology requirements from operators in the sector for both design and information management tools.AVEVA's financial performance was resilient despite the challenging conditions in our core end markets.In addition to delivering solid results, we made good progress in delivering against our strategy during the year and in structuring the business to enable future growth.Revenue increased 7.1% to £215.8 million (2016 – £201.5 million James Kidd Chief Executive Officer " WE MADE GOOD PROGRESS IN DELIVERING AGAINST OUR STRATEGY DURING THE YEAR AND
