approximately 2,800 boepd, compared with approximately 1,700 boepd at 2016 year end.OUTLOOK Focus during 2018 at MEX GOL and SV fields on completion of geophysical studies on existing seismic data and refinement of new geological model, workover of SV 12 well, planning for new well, installation of additional compression equipment, continued investment in gas processing facilities and pipeline network, the fiscal and economic situation in Ukraine continues to improve, with a better economic outlook, GDP growth and improved stability in the Ukrainian Hryvnia exchange rates, although the inflation rate did increase moderately.Nevertheless, there continue to be stresses in the economy and weaknesses in the Ukrainian banking sector.On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank each of Keith, Alastair and Adrian for their valued contributions during their respective tenures with the Company.Outlook While there are still challenges in the business environment in Ukraine, the situation is improving and the Group is continuing to progress the development of its Ukrainian fields.at the VAS field, planning took place for the acquisition of new 3D seismic over the field and the drilling of the VAS 10 well, both of which activities commenced in early 2018.Health, Safety, Environment and Security ("HSES") The Group is committed to maintaining the highest HSES standards and the effective management The Group's average daily production for the period from 1 January 2018 to 28 March 2018 from the MEX GOL and SV field was 272,656 m3/d of gas, 53 m3/d of condensate and 32 m3/d of LPG (2,169 boepd in aggregate the initial production rates were very encouraging and the well has been producing consistently in excess of 90,000 m 3 /d since then.In early 2017, the Group entered into an agreement with NJSC Ukrnafta, the majority State owned oil and gas producer, in relation to the SV 2 well, which is a suspended At the VAS field during 2017, planning work took place for the acquisition of new 3D seismic data over the field and the drilling of the VAS 10 well.The acquisition of the 3D seismic is expected to be completed shortly and thereafter the data will be processed and interpreted.The VAS 10 well was spudded on Limited, the interpretation work being undertaken on the reprocessed 3D seismic dataset and the ongoing revision of the geological model means that the Group considers that now is an appropriate time to undertake a reassessment of the remaining reserves and resources at the MEX GOL and SV fields.Sergii Glazunov Chief Executive Officer 05

has a duration of 20 years.The field is also located, geologically, towards the middle of the Dnieper Donets sedimentary basin in the north east of Ukraine.The field is trapped in an anticlinal structure broken into several faulte The ERCE Report estimated the remaining Reserves as at 31 December 2013 in the Visean B Sands reservoirs of the MEX GOL and SV fields, based on the drilling of ten further wells.as follows: Proved (1P) Proved + Probable (2P) Prove The Group made a profit of $2.3 million (2016: $1.3 million loss) during the year ended 31 December 2017, mainly as a result of improved revenue from higher production volumes and hydrocarbon prices.Revenue in the year, derived from the sale of the Group's Ukrainian gas, condensate and LPG production, was higher at $3 for the year ended 31 December 2017, the average realised gas, condensate and LPG prices were $241/Mm 3 (UAH6,412/ Mm 3 ), $67/bbl and $56/bbl respectively (2016: $213/Mm 3 (UAH5,441/ the Group and Smart Energy reached an agreement under which Smart Energy will purchase all of the Group's gas production and assume responsibility for the regulatory obligations under the Ukrainian tax regulations, as well as combining the Group's gas production with Smart Energy's own gas production so as to sell such gas as combined volumes.cost of sales for the year ended 31 December 2017 was higher at $24.3 million (2016: $18.6 million), mainly due to the inclusion of a full year of the cost of sales of hydrocarbons from the VAS field of $5.7 million (Period from 4 July 2016 to 31 this comprises a deferred tax asset of $2.6 million (31 December 2016: $3.7 million) in relation to UK tax losses carried forward, and $6.7 million (31 December 2016: $7.4 million) relating to the Group's MEX GOL and
