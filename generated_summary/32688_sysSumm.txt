04 Strategic report 2017 has been a year of heightened global and political uncertainty and prospects of continued volatility across markets.In a world where change is happening at an everincreasing pace, our strategy to be the UK's leading income focused REIT is well placed.Strategic priorities In February 2017 we held an inaugural Capital Markets Day and set out the Company's strategic priorities which have the goal of delivering superior, sustainable and growing income returns.Following a period of significant growth and transactional activity these priorities underline our ongoing ambition to become the UK's leading income focused REIT.IHL will be delisted and the portfolio will be managed as part of the Group's existing hotel portfolio.Last valued at £104.4 million, the assets include the Hampton By Hilton at Gatwick Airport, the Holiday Inn Express, Edinburgh and four Travelodge hotels providing long dated uncapped CPI linked income the income yield is expected to be commensurate with the yield achieved on the disposal and likely to be accretive to investors over the medium term.however, there can be no guarantee that such acquisition will proceed to completion, and a further announcement will be made by the Company, as appropriate, in due course The long term debt secured against four of our UK Shopping Centres was successfully restructured in the second half of the year to reduce leverage and interest costs.The aggregate facility of £167.8 million was reduced to £146.1 million, extended to April 2042 and included the termination of the historic profit share arrangement on despite this, interest rates remain exceptionally low by historic standards and the outlook for longerterm rates remains benign, suggesting that the search for yield is likely to endure as a key investment theme.Our income focused and diversified portfolio provides limited exposure to any single sector or occupier with the opportunity to allocate capital to assets and sectors where we identify the best opportunities Mediumterm target HY1 HY2 2017 Underlying EPS (guidance: 2.7 – 2.8) (p) n/a n/a 2.75 Payout ratio (%) 90.0 – 95.0 96.3 92.9 94.5 Rental income

with distribution and industrial benefiting strongly from the structural change in as occupier and customer needs evolve, flexibility and service levels are becoming an increasingly important consideration.Capital values in most markets have performed well driven by both lower investment yields and rental growth.With investment yields now broadly at levels previously seen in 2007, investment demand has become increasingly focused on sectors with rental growth expectations.Redefine International P.L.C.Annual Report 2017 12 Strategic report Superior income Sustainable income
