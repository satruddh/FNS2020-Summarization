clear that the Company operated in a challenging environment, but it had demonstrated resilience while retaining real growth potential.Focus on cost and capability Genel will continue to ensure that its cost base reflects the external economic situation.Total general and administrative cash costs were more than halved from 2014 to 2016, and the Company continues to ensure the most appropriate structure and cost base from which to grow and deliver maximum value to stakeholders.we have a robust financial position, a clear strategy, and the correct team to implement it.GENEL ENERGY 4 STRATEGIC REPORT 2017 GROSS PRODUCTION (bopd)  Tawke – 105,460  Taq Tag – 18,050  Peshkabir – 3,590 CAPEX/OPEX FY2017 ($ million)  Tawke/ We went into the year with a clear focus, and took proactive steps to deliver our key goals.CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S STATEMENT ANNUALREPORT2017 7 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION Prudent capital allocation is at the core of everything the successful Peshkabir 2 well was followed by the equally successful Peshkabir 3 well, and production of c.5,000 bopd from the former was commingled with the latter to end the year at a very consistent 15,000 bopd from the field.this focus on expenditure and value creation, with a cash investment of $345 million in buying back bonds at below par reducing gross cash debt from $675 million to $300 million, helped to reduce our net debt as at end 2017 to $135 million.This was a 44% reduction year on year from the end 2016 figure of $2 the updated CPRs, announced in January 2018 confirmed a c.40% increase in gross combined 2C resources to almost 15 Tcf.Even at a 1C level, gross raw gas resource estimates are significantly higher than the gas volumes agreed under the Gas Lifting Agreements.Outlook Genel is a highly cash generative business, and we expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow throughout 2018.Prudent expenditure will progress the significant near term opportunities within the portfolio, and our sound financial position allows us to explore the possibility of bolstering our portfolio and adding to the strength of our core assets oil production from the Tawke, Peshkabir and Taq Taq fields generates significant free cash flow, and we will continue to maximise this through efficient reservoir management and disciplined capital allocation.Our Bina Bawi and Miran fields provide material upside opportunities, with both high value oil resources and 15 Tcf BUILD A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH VALUE ASSETS Developing a rich funnel of new opportunities, with prudent allocation of capital to the highest return projects.Genel systematically seeks opportunities to leverage our strengths and capabilities, utilising our management team members' track record in successful M&A execution The key aim is to maximise production of available natural resources over the life of field and generate maximum free cash flow.Key focus Genel is concentrating on cash generative assets in the KRI, where production costs are amongst the lowest in the world.We are also actively looking to leverage our capabilities outside KRI for accelerated profitable growth 2017 activity 66% of our capital expenditure was value accretive, cost recoverable, spend on our producing assets.Coupled with another year of consistent payments this helped generate material free cash flow, and the successful refinancing in December 2017 solidified a significant improvement in the balance sheet, reducing year end Definition Cash flow generated from operating activities, minus capital expenditure, before interest payments.Definition Lost time incident frequency measures the number of lost time incidents per millions work hours.Definition Loss of primary containment records any unplanned or uncontrolled release of material from a piece of equipment (such as a pipe, vessel, or tank) Performance There was a solitary loss of primary containment in 2017, as a production facility heater suffered an internal fire at Taq Taq.There were no injuries or spills.The heater was decommissioned and replaced with another unit, with updated and safer technology.Relevance to strategy Our strategy is to enhance the value of 4.2 4.4 5.5 5.9 4.8 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 TOTAL NET RESERVES AND UNRISKED RESOURCES (Bboe) 5.5 2016: 4.4 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 85 53

gross 2P stood at 55 MMbbls, compared to The Company also looks to replace 2P reserves through a combination of maturing contingent resource to commerciality, exploration for new sources of hydrocarbons and M&A activity.Relevance to strategy Prospective resources are those quantities of hydrocarbons estimated to be potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application of future development projects, and have the potential to drive GENEL ENERGY 14 STRATEGIC REPORT OPERATING REVIEW Cash generative oil production, opportunities in the portfolio Bill Higgs Chief Operating Officer ANNUALREPORT2017 15 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION TT Tawke Peshkabir activity at Taq Taq in the year led to a stabilisation of production, with the TT 29w then contributing to an uplift at the end of the year.Average production in 2018 to date has been 33,300 bopd, in line with guidance.Genel has booked 504 MMbbls gross (126 MMbbls net working interest) 2P reserves at the Tawke PSC, as a 133% increase in 2P reserves at Peshkabir to 75 MMbbls helped to offset a downward technical revision of Genel's 2C raw gas resources at Miran and Bina Bawi were lifted c.40% to 14,792 Bscf, a figure which excludes associated condensate volumes attributable to the upstream partners of 137 MMbbls.Taq Taq PSC (44% working interest, joint operator) Production in 2017 averaged 18,050 bopd, with production stabilising in the second half of the year.
