have acted with impressive decisiveness in embedding Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2017 05 Against this background of strategic activity, the team maintained the focus on shortterm performance.The business delivered a stable performance in line with our expectations against an extremely challenging market backdrop of slower academic funding in the US and Europe and the anticipated deteriorati The year has been one of transition with a new strategy, associated portfolio changes and the formation of a new leadership team.The most notable strategic development has been the launch of the Horizon strategy, our transformational programme for the Group, which will drive both our future direction and our operational model.Summary • Horizon strategy underway, repositioning the Group for longterm growth • Continued strength and improved profitability across NanoTechnology Tools sector • Steady performance in Industrial Products • Increased demand for services related to our own products 01: Strategic Report 02: Governance 03: Financial Statements 04: Company Information Oxford Instruments plc • This remains a core market for our businesses and we continue to build strong relationships with the leaders in this field, ranging from Nobel Prize winners through to Quality Assurance for leading manufacturers.Quantum Technology is the exploitation of the regime where quantum effects dominate and radically change the 'rule book' of what is possible.Looking back over the previous financial year, the Group delivered a stable performance, supported by stronger secondhalf trading in line with our expectations and currency tailwinds.This was despite an uncertain macroeconomic background, which has seen a sustained period of slow global academic and R&D funding and continued softness across industrial end markets Constant currency revenue declined in Europe by 5.9% with growth in France and Germany being more than offset by reduced volumes from the Rest of Europe, principally from lower shipments from Plasma Technology, and it declined in North America by 12.0%, predominantly due to reduced volumes in OI Healthcare and Asylum Research.Asylum Research underperformed against the previous year having been disproportionally impacted by reduced academic funding levels and a delay in launching new products.As a result of prioritising investments and delivering operational efficiencies we expect to see an improvement in the profitability of the Asylum business, albeit still below original projection The Group continues to invest in future products and services and in the year we increased investment in R&D by 7.1% to £30.3 million (2016: £28.3 million).We monitor the proportion of our revenue which originates from products launched in the last three years (our Vitality Index).Our Vitality Index stands at 31%, Providing tools to support the commercialisation of nanotechnology into everyday products.New business model The market we operate in has changed dramatically with Nanotechnology migrating from fundamental research to being adopted in mainstream applied R&D and the exploitation into a range of commercial applications that are available to a larger enduser base To support our customers' new requirements, we will build our leadership in exploiting our expertise, skill and intellectual property in fabrication, manipulation and characterisation of materials, structures and devices down to the molecular and atomic scale.We will focus our investment on those market segments where nanotechnology drives longterm growth for Energy where improved efficiencies and sustainability remain core drivers and includes work in photovoltaics and batteries.Quantum Technology is the exploitation of the regime where the exotic quantum effects dominate and radically change the 'rule book' of what is possible.Advanced Materials where we can help customers lead the race to develop lighter, stronger, higher functioning and The NanoTechnology Tools sector comprises two divisions: NanoCharacterisation, which includes NanoAnalysis, Andor Technology and Asylum Research; and NanoSolutions, which includes NanoScience, Plasma Technology and our minority share in the ScientaOmicron JV.Results for NanoTechnology Tools Constant 2017 2016 currency £m £m Growth growth 1 Revenue 208.6 187.3 11.4%
