Government of Indonesia  Impairment charges against HYLAS 1, HYLAS 2 and Cash at the year end of $32.7m (2016: $56.4m)  Net debt 1 at the year end of $562.0m (2016: $588.9m)  David Williams, CEO, steps down shortly after the year end.1 Net debt comprises current and non current loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalent Alan is focussed on rebuilding the sales momentum of the business and ensuring that the Group has a go to market strategy that is fit for the current market.The search for a full time replacement is underway and we hope to make an announcement shortly.As recently announced, the Board has launched a restructuring of the Company's balance sheet since the conclusion of the strategic review and the successful provision of additional financing, we won some significant new business and believe that the pipeline conversion rate should now accelerate.In late December 2016 we received significant new tender awards and signed contracts in the wi fi and cellular backhaul markets and in government networks.This will include the deployment of the Avanti ECO initiative across Sub Saharan Africa, which will provide ECO Wi Fi services to schools and communities, addressing the digital divide in the region.By combining Avanti's world leading satellite technology with the market reach expertise from Millicom, the partnership will additionally commission a new Gateway Earth Station (GES) The addition of this new capacity, which increases available capacity from 14GHz to 17GHz means the utilisation metric has been re based.The amended fleet utilisation is in the 30 35% band (June 2016 re based: 25 30% band).The tactical 4 GHz HYLAS 3 is a hosted payload flying on board Outlook HYLAS 4 is due for launch in March 2018 with a target of being in orbital position ready for service at the start of the next financial year.We are in discussion with a number of current and new distributors to sign up master partnership distribution agreements with Avanti to market this new capacity which is largely over sub Sahara According to Cisco, Africa and Middle East is the fastest growing mobile data market in the World increasing 12 fold over the 5 years to 2021, and therefore Avanti is well placed to serve this growth.KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS The Top 20 Customer Bandwidth Revenue Growth metric helps to track Avant Avanti charges its service provider customers for the use of its network and other assets in a number of ways: broadband packages, managed capacity, fully integrated project fees, raw capacity, pure spectrum and a number of other product categories and charging models to suit customer and market circumstances.Avanti connects people wherever they are – in their homes, businesses like other infrastructure companies, Avanti's business model involves significant upfront capital expenditure to launch services and a largely fixed operating cost base.This is expected to result in initial cash outflows being followed by strong cash inflows as the business grows.The satellite industry has very high barriers to entry.These include the intellectual capital that is needed to design and run a Avanti's end user application segments, which remain unchanged, are:  Commercial Mobility  Enterprise Data – including cellular backhaul  Government & Military  Broadband Access Avanti's focus is on developing deep relationships with a small number of large key channel partners in the following three distribution channels after the drawdown of the HPS funds in July 2017 the gross debt of the Company was $926.5 million, as set out in the table below: Maturity Interest Rate Face Value Book Value Cash (%) PIK (%) $ millions $ millions Super Senior June 2020 7.5 n/a 100.0 95.8 2021 notes October 2021 The carrying value of the 2023 notes was reduced from $481.6 million to $245.6 million with the difference being credited to the income statement (note 9), along with accelerated amortisation of previously capitalised bond costs of $16.8m.Tax There was a tax credit of $12.0m to the income statement ( Balance Sheet Impairments Each year the Group considers the carrying value of its assets and looks for indications of impairment.Falling market prices for satellite services have reduced the ability of future cash generation to make up for the slower than expected revenue generation in the earlier years of HYLAS 1 and HYLAS 2.With the satellites having a finite life Avanti is confident that the arbitration panel will rule in the Group's favour and has provided for the debt at the year end until the uncertainty related to enforcing the arbitration panel's expected ruling has been sufficiently reduced.During the year we terminated a contract with Qsat in Ireland for consistent non payment The HYLAS 1 and 2 in orbit insurance policies were renewed in November 2017 with an insured value of £112m and $306m respectively.STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW continued 10 Avanti Communications Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Backlog Our backlog comprises our customers' committed contractual expenditure under existing contracts for the sale of bandwidth Continued uncertainty regarding the terms of the UK's exit from the EU may have some effect on our ability to attract suitable UK based staff.Foreign exchange risk We operate internationally and are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the pound Sterling and the Euro.Whilst the risk of launch failure is historically very low when using the Arianespace 5 launch vehicle, and the spacecraft is insured for $325 million, any failure would significantly impact the business model.A replacement vehicle would take approximately 30 months to procure.Post balance sheet events In July 2017 the Company drew down $100 million of the There can, however, be no certainty that the required consents will be received or that the refinancing will be successfully completed.Accordingly, successful completion of the refinancing, planned fund raise and the substantial achievement of cash flow forecasts represent a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the group and the parent company For areas identified as having a high importance, we have either already developed strategies and have controls in place and are reporting on performance, or we are developing more detailed strategies within our existing systems to focus on specific aspects.By monitoring our performance in this way we will also get valuable feedback for use in the continual improvement of our policies, processes and procedures Through encouraging diversity within its workforce, Avanti aims to reflect better the diversity of its customer base in order to respond better to its demands.
