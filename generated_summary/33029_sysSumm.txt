world's most serious health challenges: heart disease, diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders, infection, medicine's development to understand where the greatest clinical needs Few pharmaceutical companies in the world, if any, can match the combination of capabilities that we have in small molecules, biologics, immunotherapies and antibody engineering.These capabilities allow us to produce combination therapies (such as drug antibody conjugates and bispecifics) and customisable molecules, both targeted to specific patient populations To be able to do this, people must have confidence in

ensure that patients' wellbeing is maintained.Post launch research and development Studies to further understand the safety profile of the medicine in larger populations.
