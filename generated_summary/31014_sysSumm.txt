in particular coal, where lower Chinese production and logistical disruptions arising from seasonal factors Private equity investors showed a preference for copper, which saw 70% of investment, with Africa being the most popular jurisdiction, seeing 13 deals, totalling US$1,036m (45%; 2017).The strong performances of coking and thermal coal in 2016 similarly led to large increases in deal flow lithium assets in lower political risk regions such as South America and Australia should see growing interest, whilst cobalt assets outside of the Democratic Republic of Congo are likely to be of interest given the challenges posed in that country.the DRC's heightened risk profile is driven in part by the recently revised mining code which includes increases in mining royalties, 12 ANGLO PACIFIC GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 APG_AR17_28.03.18_FRONT_ARTWORK HOW WE CREATE VALUE FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS Our most recent investments (Narrabri, Maracás Menchen, the Denison financing arrangement and the Group believes cash flow to shareholders can be maximised through economies of scale, which would allow for growth in the portfolio without significantly increasing our cost base.Lower risk through top line, revenue participation in mining companies Revenue based royalties limit the Group's direct exposure to operating or capital cost inflation of the underlying mine operations an alternative form of financing to conventional equity, which can be an expensive form of finance Compared to the issuance of new equity, royalties and streams do not depend on the prevailing state of the capital markets but are rather the result of bilateral negotiations.
