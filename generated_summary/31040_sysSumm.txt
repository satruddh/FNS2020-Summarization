2017, and the Company Secretarial function was also brought in house following the appointment of Emma Versluys as Company Secretary.Paul James joined the Company and Board as Chief Financial Officer on 5 March 2018, and I believe that the executive management team is now at full complement following this period of change In addition to our ongoing initiatives, in 2018 our attention will be focused upon:  Continuing to develop our core manufacturing capabilities by investing in further new capacity and automation to help grow both revenues and profit organically.Continued progression of the Group's M&A agenda.PEOPLE The exceptional effort and ongoing commitment of our employees continues to be a key driver the strong performance in the year is testament to the strength of the growth drivers on which the Group's strategy is based, namely legacy material substitution, tailwinds from both water management and carbon reduction legislation, and development of selective export markets.With a continued focus on investment into engineered solutions to meet those needs, an experienced and dedicated senior management team, committed workforce Understanding the detailed characteristics and complexity of the individual projects requires Polypipe to work closely with the customers' design engineers to understand these problems, in order to be in a position to propose an appropriate engineered solution.Working closely with end customers in this way helps to generate pull through demand for Polypipe's solutions through the distribution channel PRODUCTION OF PIPE AND FITTINGS SERVES AS A FOUNDATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GROUP'S SOLUTIONS DISCRETE PRODUCTS PIPING SYSTEMS SMART SOLUTIONS DATA DRIVEN MONITORING UK house price inflation in 2017 was 3.0% compared to 2016 according to Nationwide, indicating that the supply of properties onto the market slowed in line with demand.As long as house price inflation continues, housebuilders will be keen to increase supply, especially given that the Government's Help To Buy schemes have skewed demand towards Construction output % growth – 2015 constant prices Housing completions in Great Britain Private and

the year ended 31 December 2017 Polypipe Group plc 10 CASE STUDY O 2 HOTEL CASE STUDY SEACOAL HOUSE DEMONSTRATING: THOUGHT LEADERSHIP ENGINEERING DESIGN SUSTAINABILITY IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT A combination of emerging factors such as climate change, increasing urbanisation, skills shortages on site, and changes in legislation is leading the construction sector to seek innovations and modern methods to tackle these challenges, while ensuring safe on site working methods, reduced time to install and reduced total cost of ownership.Polypipe can propose solutions that address indoor air quality through active filtration systems to remove particulates, and humidity and temperature management systems.Many ventilation systems specified today include heat recovery systems, Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery (MVHR) that, as well as improving air quality, also recover heat from the air being expelled with Polypipe's UK standard based products, and the esteem that UK manufacturing is held in within a number of growing markets around the world, the Company seeks to expand in selected further markets.Many factors supporting Polypipe's growth are not unique to the UK, such as urbanisation, managing water as a scarce resource, combined sewer systems already at capacity New continuous corrugation investment at Horncastle Investment in robotic automation at

objectives and delivery of sustainable shareholder returns As the Group grows, efforts continue on continuous improvement initiatives towards achieving a Group wide, shared safety culture.GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS The Intensity Ratio is defined as the total tonnes of scope 1, 2 and 3 CO 2 e produced per total tonnes of production therefore, in an environment where extreme storm events are becoming frequent, and existing combined sewage outfall infrastructure is reaching capacity, the use of plastics can be engineered as a very effective part of the solution to manage water.
