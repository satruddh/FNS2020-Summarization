"A. C. Quinn CBE Chairman I am pleased to be contributing to the annual report for the first time as Bodycote's Chairman.06 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2017 25695 19 March 2018 3:29 PM Proof 7 The Board has been further strengthened by the appointment of Lili Chahbazi, who joined as a Non Executive Director on 1 January 2018.Lili is an experienced strategy consultant and, since 2008, a global partner in the results of these investments, together with the continued diligence in operational efficiency and a more benign macro environment all combined to deliver another good set of results for the Group in 2017.Bodycote remains well placed to capitalise on the value generating investments available to it and the prospects for the Group are excellent Growth in onshore oil & gas saw a strong sequential increase in 2017, driven predominantly by demand from unconventional drilling activity in the Permian Basin.In the rest of the energy sector, subsea revenues continued to decline and large frame industrial gas turbines (IGT) are also in retreat following cutbacks at Also impacting our HIP Services business was an unplanned outage during the second half (which was fully resolved by year end).Forecast growth in all the Specialist Technologies looks strong.The five sites we acquired in 2016 are performing well.They are all Classical Heat Treatment sites within the AGI division and contributed £23.0m of revenue in 2017, The Group has a minimum 20% hurdle rate return when looking at investments.During 2017 we made further progress against our strategy, delivering higher Group return on sales of 18.0%.We believe there is still the opportunity to further improve from both management led initiatives, particularly in our AGI division, and growth in our higher return Specialist Technologies Strong growth was achieved through contributions from contract wins on automotive and aerospace programmes, excellent growth in Emerging Markets (where our investments are yielding good returns), and broad based growth across the general industrial sectors.an element of which was due to some customer restocking.The Group's revenue growth, combined with continued discipline on costs, helped lift Bodycote seeks to secure service specific arrangements with our customers which provide protection from supply disruption by leveraging Bodycote's unique facility network.Bodycote's global network of 187 market focused facilities (see pages 4 and 5) in 23 countries brings economies of scale, particularly for logistics and equipment

global and local requirements of the market sectors in which our customers operate and providing the highest levels of customer service in terms of quality, delivery, reliability and technical problem solving.T echnology Providing thermal processing services that are a vital link in the manufacturing supply chain, and value the surface is hardened via a specialised nitriding process during which nitrogen is diffused into the surface to increase resistance to in service stress and fatigue.After heat treatment, the masking is removed and the surface cleaned before inspection to ensure the part meets strict aerospace quality specifications.During use, a vehicle places heavy demand on its transmission, requiring a fast and reliable response to the drive controls.The gears require high strength and wear resistance in order to withstand the stresses applied to each gear during use.Bodycote's heat treatment processes, in particular Low Pressure Carburising (LPC), enable modern transmissions to through the simultaneous application of heat and pressure, the HIP process eliminates internal porosity, improving fatigue strength, tensile ductility and fracture toughness.Surface hardness What is it?The ability of a material to resist deformation, scratching and indentation under force.some metals and alloys must operate at temperatures close to their melting point.Heat treatment enables them to perform at higher temperatures with little or no movement.CiD Corr I Dur ® (CiD) A proprietary thermochemical treatment for the simultaneous improvement of corrosion and wear resistance through the generation of a nitride oxide combination layer Performance Headline earnings per share increased by 12.2 pence (33.0%) during the year, from 37.0 pence to 49.2 pence.Definition Headline earnings per share is defined in note 10 to the financial statements.Performance Return on sales increased by 1.4 percentage points during the year, from 16.6% CO 2 equivalent emissions are

actual rates), including a contribution of 0.8 percentage points to the growth from new facility investments.Civil aviation growth was underpinned by a strong UK performance.
