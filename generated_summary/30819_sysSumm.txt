Revenue £51.9m Divisional Review – Personal Injury During 2017 we made strong progress in preparing for the regulatory changes previously announced by the Ministry of Justice.It is anticipated that these changes will take place no earlier than Q2 2019.Summary of Financial Performance 2017 has been a year of considerable change for the Group, primarily in our Personal Injury (PI) division.We performed as expected, with 2017 revenue ahead at £51.9m (2016: £50.6m), primarily due to a 5.5% increase in PI revenues Divisional Review – Residential Property The Group's Residential Property (RP)

ventures have been encouraging and we continue to manage and monitor these carefully.Having reduced investment in the National Accident Helpline brand in 2016 we have been able to successfully relaunch the brand during the year.The new campaign is generating positive results with brand metrics improving strongly.Having managed that aspect of our business as planned and whilst satisfied with the early contribution of our new ABS ventures, we believe that these structures offer a valuable opportunity to leverage the Group's core skills in the PI market to drive future returns still further.
