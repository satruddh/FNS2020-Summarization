operational flexibility.the original investment plan developed for RP2 was based on more modest flight growth.NATS Holdings Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report | 09 Progress Chief Executive's review Martin Rolfe Overall we made good progress in implementing our strategic objectives this year and achieved all but one of the priorities we set ourselves.I was pleased with our performance as we handled the most rapid growth in air traffic volumes in a decade Airspace in the South East is now operating to its maximum capacity during the busiest times of the year.When the airspace is at capacity our service performance is very sensitive to the timing and distribution of traffic flows across the country.This was evident last summer when periods of bad weather combined with industrial action in neighbouring countries (causing flights to divert into UK airspace) We also welcome Government's clear decision on the location of a new runway and a faster planning process to deliver it.We have already started working with Heathrow Airport and other stakeholders to review the design of the local airspace, taking account of safety, noise and other environmental considerations.During the year we were awarded the ATC contract by George Best Belfast City Airport and renewed ATC contracts with Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports, along with our engineering contract with Highlands and Islands Airports.However, the Edinburgh Airport ATC service will transfer to a competitor at the end of March 2018 and we are working with a large part of our strategy over the next five years is to replace much of our technical infrastructure.This infrastructure has served us well but is coming to the end of its useful life.Updating this technology will be a significant change for everyone working for NATS and this priority recognises that we will need to support our people through this transformation NATS Holdings Limited Annual Report and Accounts
