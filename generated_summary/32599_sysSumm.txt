increased territory build subsidies to agents joining from competitors accounted for £1.2m compared with £0.7m last year.Management's view is that this is a business development cost as new territory builds are usually loss making in the first year, but result in high Impairment is arguably more closely related to credit issued, and on this metric the level of impairment of 16.8% of credit issued is only slightly higher than 15.4% of credit issued last year.
