annual dividend and capital growth opportunities McBride's extensive network the first of our three phased approach of 'Repair', 'Prepare' and 'Grow' focused on transforming McBride to its core capability of manufacturing excellence.Following our customer simplification exercise, we have been able to re establish top quality service levels to our customers, accelerate our innovation cycle and substantially improve on now, the 'Prepare' phase is a period of bridging from where McBride was and to where we aspire to be – moving the Company from 'Repair' to 'Grow.'It comprises four objectives that will enable us to build the foundations to sustain our ambitions Our 'Prepare' phase encompasses four objectives: This signalled our transition to the second phase – the 'Prepare' phase of our strategy and to launch the significant projects that are crucial to delivering this phase, and preparing us for growth.3.4.The Commercial Strategy To create clarity on the segments, the markets and We distinguish these as Traditional Retail, Limited Assortment Discounters and Contract Manufacturing, with online platforms starting to develop and gain momentum.Although we observe some convergence between the different supply models, we still need to optimise our product offering and supply chain capabilities to serve these different channels.Acquisitions – the third element in our growth In the past year, McBride has invested substantially in the strengthening of the organisation together with the HR processes to ensure the long term sustainability of our organisational

restricted the flexibility of having capacity available of the required format in the right location an inherited legacy of shared Household and Personal Care facilities, high product complexity, inefficient layout and relatively weak productivity meant the site was ill prepared to meet both today's demands and the increasing expectations of our customers.A major turnaround project was necessary to transform the site and enable it to play an effective role in the 'Pre 17 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report Case study Packaging design has an ever increasing impact and relevance for both the cost and the attractiveness of our products.Consumers often decide within the first few seconds as to whether the product on offer looks attractive, different and reliable These attributes are augmented further by our financial strength that enables us to support additional expansion initiatives from contract manufacturing customers.McBride's strategic ambition is to be the preferred external supply solution partner to brand owners, supported by the right relationships and supply performance.As an example, in the laundry capsule category, McBrid McBride worked in close partnership with the Category Buying Director of a major retailer in Australia, to develop an auto dishwash product brief for our global R&D team, based in Europe.The work focused on attaining industry leading performance across all stain sets that were relevant to the Australian market.
