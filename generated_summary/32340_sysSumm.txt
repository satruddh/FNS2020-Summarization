resulted in a clear articulation of our purpose and the evolution of our vision, values and the strategic priorities that guide our business.You can read more about these on page 8.I am pleased that John has delivered a very strong performance in his first year as Chief Executive.Together with his team, he has made significant progress on Standing back from the detail of these accounts, I would like to highlight two aspects.Firstly, the strength of the balance sheet and our key credit metric of retained cash flow divided by adjusted net debt.Secondly, the cash flows in the business, which have enabled us to grow the full year dividend in line with g 3 has now been certified for use on part of our network and the equipment insulated with this gas is now energised.National Grid recognises the wider role we can play in helping communities have fair and equal access to opportunities to be successful.We work with community groups, charities and educational institutions to help address some of the challenges felt by The topic of corporate governance has been the subject of considerable political and media attention in the UK during 2016/17.The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) is now undertaking a fundamental review of the UK Corporate Governance Code and we shall be an active participant in its consultation process.Your Board continues to be very mindful of the need to create value for this is why our leadership team has conducted a strategic review of our business to articulate our purpose and evolve our vision and strategy.I am excited by the evolution of our strategy, which we are setting out in this report.Our performance in 2016/17 In terms of safety, our overall lost time injury frequency rate for the Group was 0.08 We worked closely with the purchasing Consortium to ensure a smooth transition for our customers and employees so that services continue to be delivered safely and efficiently.The sale puts our portfolio in a strong position to support higher growth and to continue delivering an attractive dividend while maintaining a healthy balance sheet.While the proposals are subject to consultation, we support the principle of greater separation of the ESO role within National Grid.We believe it is the most effective way to balance the interests of consumers with the need to maintain security of supply in a fair and competitive energy market.We look forward to working with the regulator and our stakeholders to deliver the best possible in the US, investment in solar, battery storage and energy efficiency continues apace.With such change happening all around us, we cannot stand still.That's why we have developed our thinking on National Grid's purpose, vision and strategic direction.Our purpose, which sets out why we exist, and what we bring to our customers and wider society, is simple our annual employee engagement score has risen to 77% from 73%.If we are to achieve the strategic objectives I have described, it's important that we continue to make sure our employees have the right skills and capabilities to lead us through this period of change.Over the past year, we've delivered an average of 6.5 days of technical, safety So, our vision statement clearly describes the ambitious challenge we have set ourselves – to make sure we deliver value for them every day.Our vision also looks to the future, reminding us of the critical role we will play for future generations.We are already seeing changes in our energy system as more renewable and decentralised generation is introduced.For example, our partnership with Sunrun, the largest dedicated residential solar company in the US, allows us to increase our capability in the distributed energy space, and enhance our ability to meet the changing energy needs of our customers and communities.Our values We know that how we deliver is as important as what we deliver.If our purpose is the 'why', Coal plants are closing down and being replaced with nuclear, renewables and gas, as well as emerging battery storage.During the transition, electricity margins need to be monitored and actively managed as we move to a generation mix with greater volumes of intermittent generation.Our world is changing as a result of human activity and its impact on this year, for the first time, we saw periods where no coal fired power stations generated electricity in the UK.The UK BEIS green paper on industrial strategy included a focus on developing education and skills for energy innovation.In the US, state regulators continue to support energy innovation projects through programmes such as New York State's 'Reforming the Energy Vision' We continue to work with BEIS and Ofgem on the development of future energy systems as we respond to the shift to low carbon energy in the UK.In the US, we support the Clean Power Plan.
