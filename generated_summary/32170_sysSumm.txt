the year numbered only two sites, for a gross development cost of £13.8 million, the number of potential opportunities has increased markedly.We are currently on site at a further six schemes with a gross development cost of £31 million, which is a significant uplift from this time last year our team of portfolio and investment managers has responsibility for identifying value enhancing asset management opportunities, such as lease extensions and redevelopments within our existing estate, as well as new acquisition opportunities.This structure enables us to ensure that we can maximise the efficiency with which we can translate increased rental income into underlying profit and hence dividends These new facilities highlight that the increased financial strength of Assura is enabling us to source new unsecured funding at attractive rates.We have sustained a strong, long term and diversified debt profile, with 81% of our borrowings now at fixed rate with an average maturity of 8.7 years, while this reflects that larger scale practices can more easily manage extra services and extended hours, as well as potentially delivering greater efficiencies in operations and back office functions.To this end, there are a number of different ways that GPs can work together: through formal alliances, federations and clusters of merged practices.Assura is uniquely placed both to deliver and support in this time of unprecedented change.Jonathan Murphy CEO 22 May 2017 9 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information What we need Our business model and strategy
