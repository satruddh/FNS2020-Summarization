from the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and other European regulators as they reform the way that contracts for difference (CFDs) and spread betting products are offered.The Group welcomes strong regulation and is working with regulators throughout the consultation periods, to achieve their objectives The Board is recommending a final dividend of 5.95 pence per share, which represents a total ordinary dividend of 8.93 pence per share.Outlook 2018 will be an important year for the Group as the regulatory changes are finalised and the way the Group will best serve the needs of our clients within that environment becomes clear.Own funds generated from operating activities were £47.0 million for the year ended 31 March 2017 and the Group continues to have a strong regulatory total capital ratio of 31.5% as at 31 March 2017.Although the Group's policy is to pay 50% of profit after tax as dividends, given the Group's strong cash generation and liquidity position our financial performance has been lower than last year driven by lower client activity resulting from an unusual lack of market volatility for large parts of the year.However, active client numbers and client assets have continued to increase.I am therefore confident that we have the right foundations in place for the business moving forwards this transaction is expected to be highly profitable for both CMC Markets and ANZ Bank once we have fully integrated the software and migrated their clients onto our platform which is expected to commence in September 2018.Combined with our existing business we will have in excess of 300,000 annually active stockbroking retail clients, a number of intermediaries and total CEO report 1 Net revenue generated from CFD and spread bet active clients
