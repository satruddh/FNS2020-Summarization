the first instance, I would like to thank Shareholders for their support over each of DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS 2017's underlying revenue growth of 3.4% included positive growth in all four Operating Divisions for the first time since GAP was launched.DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS 2017's underlying revenue growth of 3.4% included positive growth in all four Operating Divisions for the first time since this reflects steady operational progress across the business, with further strong growth at Global Exhibitions supported by improving growth at Business Intelligence and Academic Publishing, and a return to positive growth at Knowledge & Networking.The combination of consistently strong underlying growth and our targeted GAP expansion strategy has propelled Global Exhibitions to become the largest contributor Towards the end of the year, we further reduced our exposure to the more volatile end of the Books market through the sale of lower level textbook publisher Garland, which should help further stabilise the Books business in 2018.We continued to invest in new growth opportunities through 2017, particularly in digital, data and open access over the last four years, around £80m has been invested in a range of projects in all four Operating Divisions, as well as centrally in Global Support.These have focused on technology that enhances Informa's core platforms, ranging from customer management systems and marketing automation tools to front end delivery platforms at the same time, management teams prioritised discovering more about Penton and testing assumptions made around where and how each part of Penton's business might best fit within Informa's portfolio.The project moved into its Combine phase in early 2017, when the formal integration of businesses, people, culture and systems got underway.project manager Helena Redshaw said: "The integration project started from a positive place, as cultural fit was an important part of the rationale for combining our businesses, and there was a strong appetite amongst colleagues to come together as one business and community."There were lots of learnings along the way that we have fed back into our change management AN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLATFORM FOR GROWTH AND SCALE Another area of investment and platform improvement in 2017 has been the upgrade to our Group wide financial reporting system, creating a common, more robust platform with the capabilities to provide efficient and effective shared services at scale.Encouragingly, 75% who expressed an opinion believed their business was now better placed to succeed, and the most commonly cited benefits of GAP were new and upgraded technology and opportunities to progress and develop personally.Informa continues to invest in the balance of talent at all levels across the Group, and our twin areas of focus are international diversity and gender mix we will continue to invest in the business, encouraging innovation and expansion, and remain focused on our customers and the verticals in which they operate.We will retain our eagerness for growth, not at any cost, but growth that delivers value, creates opportunities and drives returns for our Shareholders at the same time, more Chinese capital is being put to work in Western businesses, and the influence of innovative home grown companies with global ambitions is on the rise.The number of reviewers for new drug approvals in China is now 600 from just 60 a few years ago, with plans to have 1,600 within a year with the new tax proposals in the US, and estimates that the largest 10 US pharma companies may be sitting on as much as $160bn, a surge in merger and acquisition activity is expected for 2018.Indeed, in January alone, Sanofi and Celgene announced
