and Accounts for the year ended 31 January 2017 ('FY17').FY17 has been a year of significant change where some difficult but ultimately necessary decisions have been made the Group has delivered on the revised forecast of £10.1m adjusted EBITDA.Revenue grew by 28% to £88.8m and the Group's net debt position was substantially reduced to £13.0m following a £15.0m equity fundraise that was completed in November 2016.I am grateful for the continued support and confidence shown It would require substantial investment and time in advance of securing meaningful revenues for the Group to build this capability.5 Quantum Pharma Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report The essence of the Group's focused and simplified strategy is therefore to prioritise and concentrate its own launch efforts on UL2L products where it has first mover advantage Board changes During the year we announced a number of changes to the Board.Following the resignation of Martin Such as Chief Financial Officer ('CFO') on 7 March 2016, Chris Rigg was appointed as his replacement.On 12 July 2016 Andrew Scaife tendered his resignation as Chief Executive Officer ('CEO' Licensed medicines sit at the top of the hierarchy as they have been subjected to the most rigorous review and testing by a regulator as part of a licensing process, and other types of medicines then follow in order of their relative risk to patients and prescribers.Licensed medicines The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ('MHRA') Since the introduction of a reimbursement tariff in 2011 to drive down the cost of specials, which presently affects some but not all specials lines, the value of the market has consistently fallen year on year.This is partly the result of a reduction in the mean cost of sourcing and manufacturing specials but also reflects products moving from an unlicense This opportunity is compelling when viewed in the context of the drive to find savings across the UK's National Health Service ('NHS'), which is creating pricing pressure within the specials market and increasing competitiveness amongst specials providers.The Group's positioning and business model means it benefits from a number QPL works to some of the shortest lead times in the industry, manufacturing and delivering bespoke, unlicensed medication in as little as 15 hours.It benefits from state of the art production facilities, warehousing and dispensary capabilities, along with the expertise of a highly skilled and committed team Growth opportunities Unlicensed to licensed The Group has an opportunity to both preserve and grow its UK market share by taking a pipeline of unlicensed products through the regulatory pathway in order to license and commercialise them.The Group is differentiated in this endeavour by being able to combine the strong market position and industry The Specials division ('Specials') remains profitable and cash generative, providing a strong platform for our development programme that is predominantly focused on unlicensed to licensed ('UL2L ') products.The trading performance of the Niche Pharmaceuticals division ('Niche') has been transformed by the successful launch of a number The overall performance of these products since simplification has been very good, with the benefits of portfolio rationalisation evident.A further 3 products have been licensed in the UK and are in the process of being commercialised.There are an additional 35 products in various phases of development, of which 25 are UL2L developments.We are currently seeking to realise the potential of our product portfolio beyond the UK and extend our reach into other geographies by broadening our network of international commercial partnerships.These partnerships will seek to emphasise both export and localised manufacture together with distribution opportunities to secure market access without the need to establish our own local presence This loss is shown as a discontinued operation in the consolidated income statement as NuPharm's activities as a contract manufacturer are considered to be a separate major line of business.The cash impact of NuPharm's trading losses and closure costs during the year was £2.4m.Divisional review Niche Pharmaceuticals division ('Niche') • Aviticol TM and Colecalciferol capsules (licensed for the treatment and prevention of vitamin D deficiency) in an 800 IU strength in July 2016 and 1,000 IU strength in August 2016; • Metformin Oral Solution (licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes) The drive to secure efficiency savings across the NHS continues to create pricing pressures and changes to prescribing trends in favour of more cost effective medicines.We are seeing this most notably through a gradual shift towards prescription of tariff medicines in place of clinically equivalent but sometimes more expensive non tariff alternatives.Divisional revenue increased by 125% to £25.4m (2016: £11.3m), driven by Biodose Services, which secured a number of new homecare contracts and saw continued growth in the Stork Fertility Service ('Stork').The division delivered an adjusted EBITDA loss in the year of £0.2 Chris Rigg Chief Executive Officer 2 May 2017 14 Quantum Pharma Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Chief Financial Officer's review Repositioned for growth Underlying these results is a core Specials business model that is profitable and cash generative and a product development programme that is focused on the Group's unlicense The Niche division licensed and launched Glycopyrronium Bromide Oral Solution 1mg/5ml ('Glyco') in the UK in August 2016, its first UL2L product with meaningful volume.Following the licensing of Glyco, other specials manufacturers of the medicine in the UK were required the Board took the decision to proceed with a closure plan for NuPharm and trading ceased in January 2017.
