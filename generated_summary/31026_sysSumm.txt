of other properties such as rigidity at lightweight, conformability and comfort, as well as ease of processing.Building & Construction T FIT ® provides insulation for pipes in technical applications.It has decided, as a first step, to proceed with the installation of a second high pressure autoclave (HP2) at our site in Kentucky at a cost of some $9m, which also includes a supporting extrusion line.the investment should deliver similar incremental capacity to HP1 and is expected to be commissioned in late 2019.We have a refreshed Board with a good balance of experience to challenge, guide and support the Executives in the delivery of our strategy.The Board considers that it has fully applied all of the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code

and T FIT ® insulation products.Sales increased by 32% to £13.15m (2016: £9.99m the solid parts are made by injection moulding, rather than extrusion, which offers the possibility of creating bespoke parts that retain their shape when foamed in Zotefoams' autoclave process.Zotefoams to provide parts which are close to the final dimensions required by some end users Segment loss increased as expected due to investment in people, including a dedicated IP manager, as well as non recurring costs of £0.29m related primarily to write downs of inventory, mostly costs of machinery developments which have been superseded.As most of the value created by MEL is royalty Products using MuCell ® technology can be designed to perform like solid plastic, but will typically use 15 20% less material, realising both cost and environmental benefits by using inert carbon dioxide or nitrogen gas and reducing the plastic content at source.Most customers are in the FMCG or food packaging industries, where value is created these converters cut and shape foams into specific parts for end users and, therefore, Zotefoams' success is built on a strong relationship with the foam converters and on having products which meet the specific needs of those end users.Our ZOTEK ® foams are often sold with high levels Products We engage with our suppliers and customers to ensure that the products we produce are of a consistently high standard and meet our customers' needs.By listening to our customers, we gain an understanding of their requirements not just for the present, but for the future as well.We use this information, coupled with our extensive knowledge, to research and develop products to Given the diversity of applications for foam it is not possible to track every use for our materials, and a new idea or application may come from a foam converter, an end user or from within Zotefoams.we therefore actively monitor these and maintain flexibility to react to a wide variety of possibilities Much of our AZOTE ® foam is used in permanent packaging or packaging that is designed to be reused, while foams used in transportation, which accounts for 21% of sales, are normally specified to the lightest weight for the required physical performance.Zotefo Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 14 We measure progress against four strategic objectives: Our ambition and strategic
