Statements Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 9 Understanding our stakeholders' needs Chief Executive Q&A Q What is Halma's financial model?Halma has a simple financial model In the same period, profit has grown from £66m to £194m.This has enabled us to increase our dividend by 5% or more every year for the past 38 years.Q What does Halma look for in acquisitions?We typically acquire relatively small businesses, in the £10m to £100m price range Halma's strategy is to develop market positions primed for growth over 10 years or more.Our operating companies have growth strategies with three to five year horizons.Our focus is on supplying safety, health and environmental products that protect life and improve the quality of life worldwide.We position our businesses in relatively resilient markets growth trends in the global economy for 2017/18, in both developed and developing economies, are broadly favourable for our businesses.We expect developing socio economic conditions in Asia and South America to drive rising demand for our products used to make workplaces safer, provide healthcare, improve infrastructure safety and manage life critical resources.in

investment.The International Labor Organization estimates that work related illness and accidents cost up to 10% of GDP in Latin America, compared with under 4% in the EU.Although developed countries have the oldest population profiles (about 20% of people in Japan, Germany and Italy are aged 65 or over), the large majority of older people, and the fastest rates of population ageing, are in the

more sedentary lifestyles, changing diets and rising obesity.Halma's focus on ophthalmology and advanced blood pressure monitoring products directly relates to the diagnosis and treatment of these chronic and age related diseases.Current water consumption patterns are unsustainable.
