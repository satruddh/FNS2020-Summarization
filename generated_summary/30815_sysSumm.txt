Wunderlich to the Board as independent Non Executive Directors, both of whom have extensive international experience across a wide range of industries.Mary was a Partner at Deloitte LLP for more than 20 years and has served on a number of Boards in a non executive capacity since 2000 Strategic review While there was significant focus on stabilising the Company during 2017 – not least those handful of manufacturing sites where we have previously experienced operational issues – at the same time, we simultaneously developed a clear and objective assessment of the various businesses within the Essentra organisation together with their future potential.my fellow Board members and I would like to pay tribute and give our sincere thanks to our 345 colleagues in Puerto Rico who, in the face of significant personal challenge following hurricane Maria, have shown incredible fortitude and dedication in attending work and supporting our customers, many of whom were facing similar hurricane related issues.A stronger company Last year saw substantial change at Essentra, and restoring the Company to sustainable, profitable growth will take time.However, while there is much still to do, we made significant progress and widespread improvement during 2017 so we are already well underway.PAUL LESTER, CBE Chairman 2 March 2018 ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.with a significantly positive foreign exchange benefit, together with a modest decline from change in scope owing to the divestment of the Bristol consumer packaging site in June 2017, total revenue increased 2.9% to £1,027.3m.On an adjusted basis, operating profit was down 26.8% (at constant exchange) at £ ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM 10 STRATEGIC REPORT | CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW "During 2017, we successfully restored stability across the organisation – from our people and customers to our processes and finances.A year into my tenure, my belief in a bright future in the first instance, therefore, it was imperative to start to rebuild our corporate culture, and to develop and communicate an agreed set of values – as well as where we aim to take the business and why – to ensure we are all clear as to how we should behave while in the workplace, as well as how we will together build Essentra into the best company while 2017 marks the outset of our three step corporate change programme, nonetheless we made meaningful progress in driving widespread stability during the year: compared to a low point in H2 2016, our revenue trends have steadied; our key performance indicators (notably service and quality metrics) have increased demonstrably in all three divisions.strategy review confirmed my initial assessment; namely, that the nine businesses comprising the Essentra Group have strong and defensible strategic positions, with operating margins which can be sustained or – in the case of Health & Personal Care Packaging – improved to industry norms over the medium term strategy for Components is essentially one of evolution from a strong and relatively unique proposition.however, over and above the scope to grow the division organically through expanding into faster growing geographies and adjacent product ranges, there is also potential to achieve this through bolt on transactions.
