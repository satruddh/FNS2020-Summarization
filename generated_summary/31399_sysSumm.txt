Karish, Tanin and Blocks 12, 21, 22, 23 and 31 in Israel; We have since been able to secure a licence extension and have increased reserves through technical reappraisal of the reservoir and drilling activity, enabling the implementation of a low cost development plan.The most recent Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc.Competent Person's Report ('NSAI CPR') for Prinos estimates that this uplift in value has been realised in the space of 15 months, due to Energean's ability to execute key project milestones quickly and effectively.In addition, Energean has secured a number of attractive exploration licences in Israel, Western Greece and Montenegro, where we believe we can add value Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 15 14 Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 Greece Energean is currently the only company in Greece operating producing oil and gas assets.Interest in the country from international oil and gas companies is growing.Game changing gas discoveries The Eastern Mediterranean has seen a number of major gas discoveries in the last decade.These include the Tamar gas field, currently estimated to contain 11.2 Tcf of gas reserves, in 2009 and the Leviathan gas field, estimated to contain 21.4 Tcf of gas, in 2010, both off the A 1,700km pipeline connecting the Eastern Mediterranean's Levantine Basin (Israel) with the European gas network, via Greece and Italy, is due for completion in 2025 Known as the East Med Pipeline, this development has been classified as a European Project of Common Interest.
