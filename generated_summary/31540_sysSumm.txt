protecting offshore and onshore pipeline locations; and monitoring hazardous and explosive areas.Consequently, they demand solutions that are rigorously proven under these circumstances, and which also satisfy the constantly changing requirements of compliance legislation in the past year, we have delivered a series of high profile offshore oil & gas projects, including a solution for a major US deep water floating platform in the Gulf of Mexico.The system incorporates full HD Class 1, Division 1 COEXTM C3000 camera stations to monitor both hazardous and safe area zones.Strategic review 12 Synectics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Gaming Enterprise class recording and monitoring Synectics is a global leader in the gaming sector, with a strong presence in both North America and APAC.We have enjoyed great success in this industry in recent years, successfully delivering a series of large scale projects and expanding what was originally a Casino operators value Synectics for our ability to deliver ultra reliable, scalable, end to end solutions, backed up by proven experience, industry knowledge, and technically expert staff who respond fast.Today, we offer a turnkey approach that includes hardware, software, cameras and the integration of all these into one solution the first phase of the programme will see our Synergy 3 platform deployed to allow centralised control and management of 2,300 third party and proprietary cameras spread across the casino, the nearby theme park, and one of the resort's five star hotels.The end to end solution designed and deployed by Synectics will also integrate with key security and management systems, including to a significant degree, this is being driven by the rapid advances in technological possibilities and the resulting step changes in the service that transport organisations are able to offer their own customers.When we first worked with bus, tram, and train operators, the main priority was to provide effective onboard surveillance systems which could protect staff and passengers and deliver regulatory compliance Our markets continued 15 Synectics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic review Case study We have a deep and unique understanding of the challenges these customers face, and we draw on this to create solutions they can rely on completely – giving them peace of mind by securing the assets, people and livelihoods that they are responsible for protecting the new solution will replace the client's previous system, which required all passenger help requests to be directed via the driver.David Aindow, Synectics' Business Strategy Director, explains: "This new system will ensure passengers who need help are immediately connected with someone who has an overarching view of the network.
