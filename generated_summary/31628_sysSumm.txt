transition.I believe our performance in 2017 shows that As we manage our portfolio to achieve our strategy and to become a 3.0 business, we categorise our business into four quadrants.We allocate capital to the top two quadrants and withdraw capital from the bottom two.This quadrant based assessment leads to three pillars of strategic activity: 1.Investing around the big themes our quadrants 3 PREPARE FOR THE UPTURN • Protect and enhance competitive position • Selective investments for when cycle turns • Opportunistic revenue initiatives • Tight cost control • Fix any operational deficit 4 INVEST • New product development • Sales and marketing • Acquisition • Fix any operational deficit • Accelerate transition We have also decided to review strategic options for our Global Markets Intelligence division (CEIC and EMIS) and you will see that they are identified in this report as held for sale.These are good businesses, but ones which we believe may fit another owner's strategy better.If sold this would give us the opportunity to recycle more capital towards our big themes Growth returned slightly ahead of schedule in 2017, which we still regard as a year of transition, and our view is that 2018, the third year of our strategy, will be a year of further and accelerated growth.Andrew Rashbass Chief Executive Officer 22 November 2017 £106.5m Adjusted profit before tax
