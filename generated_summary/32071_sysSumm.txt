Providing flexible electricity generation in the UK Plutus PowerGen (PPG) is an AIM listed power company focused on the development, construction and operation of flexible power generation facilities in the UK.Our business model seeks to mitigate the current and forecast risk of an energy deficit through the development, construction and operation of a portfolio of 20MW power sites 01 PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At a Glance PPG is a holding Company with subsidiaries and investments focused on the development and operation of flexible energy generation facilities Plutus PowerGen has a 44.5% stake in each company, and earns fees of £150,000 per site per year from management contracts.Other facilities, which will be gas powered, will be held in dedicated subsidiary companies as part of a non dilutive investment model in which we will seek to obtain a majority Standalone FlexGen sites – gas powered To diversify our project portfolio, we have expanded our activities into gas powered generators, using both mains gas as well as LNG, which provides locational flexibility.These projects will allow us to take advantage of new markets and the anticipated power price volatility, as they are able to run for longer hours at HEALTHY PIPELINE Development pipeline in excess of 700MW, of which 260MW are expected to receive planning permission by the end of 2017.POSITIVE FINANCIALS Asset backed projects, with short construction times and positive revenues and EBITDA once operational.Principal revenues are derived from long term and/or repeatable The management team has been working to develop and progress a pipeline of gas powered sites in which we intend to hold majority stakes of typically 80% but may also be joint ventures.We retain complete flexibility in financing projects going forward but aim to ensure that all future gas sites operated via new companies, typically holding 20MW each as before, are Chairman's Statement In a year that saw our first site become operational, I am pleased to report our maiden trading profits 1, indicating the viability of our business model and our

STATEMENTS PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 07 Chief Executive' s Review We continue to roll out our model, which is designed to address fundamental market drivers and to be resilient in the face of In March 2017, Ofgem published a'minded to' decision, which it confirmed recently.From the winter of 2020/21, this would reduce the embedded benefits received by distribution connected generators such as PPG to the residual charge.While this change settles down, there is concern among industry participants that price volatility will increase, which in turn Over the next 18 months National Grid plans to rationalise the number of markets they operate for balancing, and also be more transparent with the data and the way that they balance.They also want to make the markets more real time: a day ahead FFR market and STOR, and an in day trading market around frequency response We started this process in the new year, and now have 80MW of projects in planning and a further 120MW in the pre planning stage.This means that we are aiming for around 200MW of gas fired generation over the next two to three years, and we continue develop our overall pipeline of 700MW further SolarFlex, which seeks to co locate firm generation and intermittent generation sources, and investigate installing exhaustible generation to build'real world' operational data sets, remains part of our strategy however has been slower to come to fruition as prospective partners have not yet decided their preferred approach.Relative to conventional diesel, this fuel eliminates sulphur oxides (SOx), reduces nitrogen oxides (NOx) by c.30% and reduces particulates.We also continually evaluate other types of green fuel and look at technology to add to our generators to comply with the more stringent requirements CHANGING NEED FOR BALANCING SERVICES As system operator, National Grid is responsible for ensuring that the UK electricity system has sufficient supply to match demand, and operates balancing services to continuously match supply to demand to avoid frequency distortions, brownouts or blackouts.Keeping the lights on Network support • Improve operational capability by lowering demands on the network • Support the distribution system and provide an important tool to accommodate intermittency of renewable sources Frequency control • Maintain system frequency within operating parameters by generating very quickly, supporting local balancing System inertia improvement • Lower the risk OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13 PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 WHAT WE DO We are applying our management expertise to the establishment of a group of subsidiaries and investments active in the development, construction our multi revenue stream model is founded upon the development of 20MW flexible generation facilities, funded through a combination of equity and asset finance via dedicated investments and subsidiaries.HOW WE CREATE VALUE see page 16 HOW WE OPERATE see above KEY RELATIONSHIPS see page 15 Land and planning Funding STOR OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 15 PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 HOW WE CREATE VALUE Our model is based upon multiple revenue streams.To take part, generators must be able to deliver a minimum of 10MW, and be capable of responding within 30 seconds and for sufficient duration.Similar to STOR, providers are paid for availability as well as for utilisation.PPG will compete in the static market, whereby energy change occurs at a pre set frequency PPAs are typically of a 5+ year duration.Energy Suppliers Capacity Market To ensure long term security of supply, the Capacity Market provides financial incentives to bring forward new investment while maximising existing generation capabilities.The structure of CM ensures technology neutrality, meaning that the lowest cost technologies that will guarantee capacity will OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 17 PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Our Strategy We have continued to make progress against our strategic priorities.We will achieve 90% of our goal to reach 200MW of flexible FFR: Via our subsidiaries and investee companies, we intend to build power generation units which reach full response within 30 seconds and can sustain supply for 30 minutes, allowing us to compete in the static FFR market.STOR and FFR are mutually exclusive, although PPG may bid for both types and run FFR outside STOR hours 2017 has been a year of continued progress for the Group in the execution of its business plan.Throughout the year we had nine management contracts in place with Rockpool investee companies, each generating £150,000 per annum of fee income which represented an annualised fee income of £1,350,000 for the year ended 30 April these fees are expected to continue under current management contracts at an annualised rate of £1.35 million in future periods.
