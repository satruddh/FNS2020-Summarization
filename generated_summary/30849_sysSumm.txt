results for the Group in 2017."I am delighted and honoured to have taken over the helm as the Chairman of Admiral at the AGM in April 2017.My predecessor Chairman's statement Whilst we devote time and

for customers' attention and loyalty, combined with appropriate regulatory oversight, is a recipe for the best possible outcome for motorists and householders.I believe that Admiral's success over the last 25 years demonstrates why.08 Admiral Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report: Chief Executive's Statement 14 % UK Motor market share 4th year of ConTe profits 41 % growth in
